# Special Interest Groups - CDP

This repo will act as a template repo to get started with CDP data specifically for the
local interest group analysis project.

Feel free to open a new issue if you would like an improvement.

## Getting Setup

1. Install miniconda
2. Create a conda environment with Python installed (`conda create --name sig-cdp python=3.9 -y`)
3. Activate that environment (`conda activate sig-cdp`)
4. Install the dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
5. Load the example Jupyter Notebook (`jupyter lab`)

The `getting-started.ipynb` notebook has some basic details of the data.
The `questions.ipynb` notebook has some questions to try.
