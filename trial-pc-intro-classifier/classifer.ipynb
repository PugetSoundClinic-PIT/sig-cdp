      "Good afternoon, Greg McConnell, I'm here on behalf of housing developers who are very concerned and oppose the introduction of just cause to new construction, your other provisions on the bill are problematic but this is the one I think could do serious damage and harm to the city, to its residents and to housing construction which would also negate revenue TOS the city and most importantly, very importantly significant affordable housing impact fees. There's no evidence of need for this bill. Historically, people were in low rent, below market units Klain that they might be victimized and forced out of their units and displaced because the owners wanted to raise the rent to market. In all of these new construction bills, the units are already renting at market, so there's nobody to protect and there was no evidence, none whatsoever presented by anybody that there was Ramped displacement or injury to market rate tenants. I'm concerned that if you pass this given all that has happened in the housing market, it will be yet another disincentive to invest in Oakland and it will hurt the cause of affordable housing and housing production generally, I've spoken to almost all of you and what I have flattened to it is this is a political decision and that is sound policy matter that you are promoting, and if you send this to the voters as a political matter, the policy will get lost in the great political debate, the consequences will be severe.\n",

Hello, good morning, my name is John, I'm a resident of district 2 and privileged to support the vibrant government communities of Oakland as an immigrant Toerp and I'm calling in strong support TOF ballot measure for expansion of Oakland just - cause, I support this measure because we need this ordinance to strengthen this ordinance now more than ever, we have a severe housing crisis in Oakland, the situation existed when just cause was first approved by city voters in 2002, has not been abated, it's gotten worse, we need to expand the units to whih it apply and is provide its benefits to more tenants, not fewer and I think this is especially important as I mentioned for our vibrant immigrant communities, many of whom are Unfo J Gnat in facing tenant Harassment, discrimination and other issues that just cause would significantly help to abate, so this is especially important given that the sunset dated 1995 on these protections means that more and more units are being built that will not be subject to just cause if the Council fails to take action and the opponents of the measure have not provided any data that this measure will decrease the supply of - housing and indeed Oakland's Behien on this, Oakland normally the leader in tenant protections at this point is behind in not expanding just cause to all units and I would urge that we correct that mistake and put this measure to the voters, thank you.

I strongly support item 7, the public financing measure introduced by Oakland rising and common cause last week and urge you the put it on the ballot.
