As you are probably aware, it is very important to the community surrounding terminal five as we testify extensively at the master use permits meeting years ago. The large locomotives that pull those container trains have very loud horns designed for trains that speed through the Plains of the Midwest . It is totally inappropriate for a tight urban setting. Very disturbing . The quiet zone was agreed to by all of the parties concerned when it was created . It was supposed to be completed over a year ago.

      "Good afternoon, Greg McConnell, I'm here on behalf of housing developers who are very concerned and oppose the introduction of just cause to new construction, your other provisions on the bill are problematic but this is the one I think could do serious damage and harm to the city, to its residents and to housing construction which would also negate revenue TOS the city and most importantly, very importantly significant affordable housing impact fees. There's no evidence of need for this bill. Historically, people were in low rent, below market units Klain that they might be victimized and forced out of their units and displaced because the owners wanted to raise the rent to market. In all of these new construction bills, the units are already renting at market, so there's nobody to protect and there was no evidence, none whatsoever presented by anybody that there was Ramped displacement or injury to market rate tenants. I'm concerned that if you pass this given all that has happened in the housing market, it will be yet another disincentive to invest in Oakland and it will hurt the cause of affordable housing and housing production generally, I've spoken to almost all of you and what I have flattened to it is this is a political decision and that is sound policy matter that you are promoting, and if you send this to the voters as a political matter, the policy will get lost in the great political debate, the consequences will be severe.\n",
