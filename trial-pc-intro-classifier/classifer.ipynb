There's no evidence of need for this bill. Historically, people were in low rent, below market units Klain that they might be victimized and forced out of their units and displaced because the owners wanted to raise the rent to market. In all of these new construction bills, the units are already renting at market, so there's nobody to protect and there was no evidence, none whatsoever presented by anybody that there was Ramped displacement or injury to market rate tenants. I'm concerned that if you pass this given all that has happened in the housing market, it will be yet another disincentive to invest in Oakland and it will hurt the cause of affordable housing and housing production generally, I've spoken to almost all of you and what I have flattened to it is this is a political decision and that is sound policy matter that you are promoting, and if you send this to the voters as a political matter, the policy will get lost in the great political debate, the consequences will be severe.\n",

As a business owner without generational wealth, access to capital and lack of culturally relevant resources, starting and trying to stay on my business was one of the Scariest Thins I've ever done, while faced with so many systemic barriers, all I wish today see was the potential to build my own self-determination and wealth for my family on our own terms. As entrepreneurs, we tap into the dream of building a business as a portal to express our fullest selves, making and producing and cooking in ways that honor our wholeness. We see these examples of culture and art manifest in beautiful ways in every corner of Oakland but we entrepreneurs condition do this when there are decades of Disinvestment and discriminatory policies. Small businesses are a natural entry point for the city of Oakland to bolster economic security, it is clear that racial inequality is tied closely with geography in Oakland, it is clear that the city of Oakland lacks the tools necessary to provide essentially services and resources to the small business owners and entrepreneurs of Oakland who need it the most especially now.\n",
