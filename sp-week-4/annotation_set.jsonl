I want to be sure though that we are not unnecessarily committing dollars that could and should otherwise be incorporated into the two year budget deliberation  so I dont want us to necessarily Pre-Commit dollars that we should be exploring as part of the spend thats going to be July 1 and beyond  so  for those  I just want to be cognizant of what is included there and what is not because thats why we have the whole two year budget process with the priorities that well be discussing tomorrow and the proposals  the budget workshops and forums that we will be can--conducting if May and June as well  but there are Ie steps that are worth supporting sooner than later  I did ask the question about the Hult lodge and whether it needed the 4 thousand of seed funding  Im not quite sure if that was the intent and that can then be removed or if were anticipating other projects that also we want to purchase or rent hotel rooms and then get FEMA reimbursed but if this Hult lodge purpose was able to get done without fund Lg  it seems like the other project that is come up would also have that ability as well.

That is--thats all I have to say today and I thank you all for your time  I cede my time  thank you.

We have an area out by the cinemas a street that goes its actually commercial area but theres residential property that backs up to that to it and theres like on Saturdays and Sundays sometimes theres eight semis parked there and the police cant do anything because its not considered residential.  The streets not so you have these semis and then it makes it hard for people coming out sometimes on the side streets or trying to go around the tractor trailer to see oncoming traffic so it becomes a a big issue.  So at this point does anyone else have any questions or concerns or we can maybe if you can redo those maps like you were talking about that may may help a lot of people and well talk to our colleagues about if it if theres an area where there needs to be some type of buffer like you said like separation of of the area.","meta":{"muni":"louisville","session_id":"b6338283980e"}}

Yes  and Mayor  thank you for the presentation  and certainly the Video was a highlight in terms of what Oakland can be  and what Oakland used to be because the reality that were living in  at least in the area that I live the district  the environment has changed dramatically and not only dealing with illegal dumping but the activities of the public safety issue just to the blight  and thats something that we as Councilmembers and certainly at the elected officials  at the end of the day  were responsible for that activity and what I see missing a great deal is the enforcement of the rules that we have  you know  is it Alright for Noel Gallo to throw his trash whenever he wants to wherever he wants to and feel good about it  you know  I think that those actions have to be corrected and it will require some type of enforcement  whether its encampment management policy because some of us  the only thing we understand is Push-Back  but yet overall what I see is our families and children are having to pay that price for the lack of action and Oakland is a beautiful  great city  great weather  and the surrounding neighborhood cities are also areas we can also celebrate with our families and thats what were currently doing  and so my advice when it comes to - the illegal dumping  the trash  we do have a dump yard there on Davis Street and San Leandro  I dont know why I have to create overtime work  extra days for me to come dump the trash over with all the city workers waiting for me to bring them the trash  theyre supposed to do what other cities do  they direct the resident to go straight to the dump yard at Davis and they get a real low fee to dump  and I think those are areas that we ought to consider dealing with the contract of Waste management  how do we establish--theyre willing to do it and I think this would be a greater effort for Oakland to recover or regain the beautiful environment that we once had.

Yeah  through the chair  you  it is a little confusing and I apologize  the original report that was drafted for Prac  we estimated the cost of the activity at the Lake at about 25 thousand per weekend  that did not include everything because were using--so  for example  for public works  the staff that were deployed to the Lake either worked overtime or were taken off of Othe tasks because the task at the Lake was so big  so what you have in the attachment in the budget summary attachment are the real costs based on what our public works team feels they feed  they need a crew to handle things at the Lake on the weekend  thats why theres that larger price tag for that.","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"d0a9aa69ba27"}}

I first wanted to provide some background here  center point developed 4 6Z 0 thousand square foot industrial building on port property commercial development in the city such as this type of building are subject to the Jobs\/Housing impact fee.  That fee was designed specifically to ensure that commercial development projects compensate and mitigate for demand and increased demand for housing in the city caused by new commercial development  simply put  when a new commercial development is constructed with new employment opportunities  it would typically draw new resident TOS the SI of Oakland and those residents will demand new housing for the city and cause impacts to housing supply and Affordability.  Thats the nexus or the legal basis for the fee  like all other fees under California law  there has to be a link between the fee  the particular land use to offset the impacts  none Ofz that is in dispute and I think staff accurately described the origin of the fee and how the ` fees applied.  What is in dispute here is the amount of the fee for this project because of the peculiarities of this project  the unique nature thats on port property and thus subject to the port operation job policy  what this means is that the newly constructed project were talking about is not like other commercial developments  its on port property so it must comply with the local hiring requirements  one of that requirement is 50% of the employees at this facility  this project is completed Wl  a tenant takes occupancy of the facility which we hope is going to happen very soon  those employees must be existing local city residents.","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"ac40100a0e72"}}

there to do a capacity study for the whole city of Louisville and it is going to include our farm to market roads its going to include sewer its going to include water all the infrastructure that we have and it is going to be conducted by outside agency which takes all the politics out of it which takes actually government officials out of it it will be some itll be a firm that will do it on their own so that we can say that its the best product for the citizens of Louisville because it was put together by someone who has nothing to gain or lose sort of speak in it it would be an honest hopefully an honest picture of what our capacity issues are for the whole city so i just want to throw that out there if i could just wrap up uh yeah thank you and really honestly though when you think about the uh the paving public works has done an outstanding job with that rating system there is no there is no pollen you know there is no squeaky i tell them all im like whoever asks about paving where the where the road is there is no squeaky wheel gets the grease these days folks right this is public works doing a fantastic experts doing a fantastic job one final question um and this may have been discussed i dont think so but can we get the names uh and and district locations for our our commission members that will that is that uh to be published uh as we do with board i bring up boards and commissions id said i wasnt but but that is clearly shows you where the locations are of our our volunteers out there serving on these these not boards and commissions but actually this is a commission so um can we get that are they is that is that already public or will it be public knowledge yes so we dont we havent uh we dont have the members identified yet so i mean ive done some outreach but i wanted to make sure that it was an actual actually got through council before i started presenting to the director of public works ideas for applicants maybe once so once they are established is that is that fair to be to know where theyre what districts they are in travis based assistant county attorney yeah i mean i think when these appointments come through they should look as similar to other appointments as possible you know have that sort of identifying information that council cares about and of course thats thats part and parcel of the of the whole goal here right is to get a snapshot of opinions um and different backgrounds and feedback from the community so this might be public works or this might be uh you were at least uh first journey through this process whoever does present those appointments may need a little bit of a training on the front end but i imagine in the long term uh that information should be available once council sees those appointments roll in and also i guess i would add the people that actually organize this that help put this process together if that would be help that would be helpful too is that we could add that im sorry im not sure i quite understood the request there the organization that that is seeking out who these who these individuals are whos going to serve and and i guess its some of these folks and and who who all was involved with it got shooting wanting to know who from public works is looking for for uh applicants to the boards yes gotcha im hoping yall can pass that along i dont know that it needs to be written into the ordinance necessarily if youd like it to but i dont think it has to be written thank you thank you madam chair councilman george thank you i would just say my hope would be after this conversation and once this is approved that we all kind of take this out into the community and try and recruit thats what i will do for folks i know who are passionate about this issue in district 21

geographic representation do you guys have standard or like can language that you use from other examples of boards and commissions im not on um government accountability so i dont know whats typical so i had looked at it and theres a we already have an existing ordinance that talks about unless you otherwise provide if youre talking about boards and commissions its in 32.001c appointments should reflect geographic political gender age racial and other elements of diversity where appropriate so that representatives on all boards and commissions are proportionate to the many facets and areas of the louisville metro community to enable an equal voice in the policy and decision making of such boards and commissions if the fact that this is worded as a coalition rather than a board and commission i think it acts as a board and commission one thing we could do is just add a c under membership that just says appointments under a and b shall comply with lmco 32.001c i would support that and i would make that in a motion and ill second that motion by councilwoman george second by councilman hollander anybody have any questions on that amendment seeing none i think were thats good all those in favor of that amendment signify by saying aye aye those opposed by like sign seeing none the motion passes thank you um county attorneys and councilwoman george and go ahead thank you  I just wanted to ask nate maybe can you give us a little bit of language or something that we can then share out into our newsletters about you know the and maybe its premature because it hasnt passed council yet but um so that you know we can share a little bit about the complete streets coalition and maybe try and do some recruiting in our areas yeah absolutely id be glad to um id welcome the support and the recruitment effort thatd be great thank you any other questions or comments seeing none this is an ordinance recall calling for a roll call vote if youll open the voting share and if you will do the roll call also share okay uh no no this is me yeah it goes on yeah so this one coming down im not gonna touch it but that one come back down there okay sheryl go ahead and do the roll call portion please committee member author yes vice chair reed yes without objection voting is closing there are seven yes votes and this will go to owed business because of the amendments okay okay the last order of business business since we have about a half an hour i think well go ahead and take full advantage of it which is an ordinance creating a new section to louisville jersey county metro government code of ordinance lmco chapter 153 regarding the processing of applications for zoning map amendments if there are delinquent taxes or valid liens held by louisville metro government that are unpaid motion arthur second triplet properly moved by councilman arthur count and seconded by councilman triplet uh were ready for discussion and i believe it will follow myself uh and uh the county attorneys office uh and if youve got a chance to read over it youll see youll see that several other agencies within within the city of louisville like the like abc ordinance and um i believe its the state building building um if you oh if you owe a delinquent tax or a lien against a property i think its imperative that if if you owe if you owe a tax or or a fine on a piece of property you shouldnt be allowed to build another piece of property when you owe the city money i dont think that sets a good record for um for the residents of this community who pay their taxes who have to pay their liens that people are rewarded by give lets just give them another permit to for a change in zoning this will require that the developer gets a statement from the revenue commission and gets a statement from um um omb that there are no liens on the properties that they own or if its the llc the members of the llc do not own the city of louisville money on other properties that they are investors in is that am i doing the okay job there laura yes we had looked at what some other jurisdictions had done in terms of your application to change the use of the property should not be processed if you so taxes to the local government or its been or theres some sort of judgment thats been reduced to a lien does anybody have any questions yes councilman hollander thank you madam chair and i like this idea i just have a question and maybe its a bit of a technical question um its about uh section uh four b so as i understand that this is designed so that if the applicant or the owner of a property is a corporation or a partnership or a um i guess a llc um that this applies to any shareholder owning ten percent or more of the voting stock or the or the partnership shares uh or uh are ten percent or more of an llc um and i guess what this means is that if if im an individual i have a lien uh i owe taxes and i own more than ten percent of one of these entities and then the entity couldnt move forward with with the rezoning i get that dont i have any objection to it but i do have a question about it  Uh how do we know i mean well at what point i assume right now the planning commission does not collect the names of all of the stockholders in a in a uh maybe they do uh do you know the ownership of of uh the voting stock of a corporation or partnership or an llc that thats making an application for change in zoning um i guess thats yeah and of course planning and design i was actually had that noted to ask that question as well because i could probably find out that question myself but im not really sure how i would train our staff to find out that question in order to determine whether or not they should be accepting an application um yeah so i dont even know and this is really i guess a question of the county attorney uh this information isnt really real easy to find i dont think the ownership of the of a ten percent of the voting stock of a corporation and to answer your first question no thats not something that playing and planning and design typically looks at so my question is how how do and again i want to be clear i im not objecting to the idea but im not sure how this works in in application i dont know whether we would be saying if youre a corporation youve got to tell us all the members of your corporation everybody on stock i mean thats one thing uh that i dont i dont know that we would want to move that way and short of doing that im not sure how we would would apply this section it would be information youd ask on the front end and and what youre i see what youre saying in terms of how you verify the accuracy of that information i think travis and i were just talking i think we have a requirement on the lease that theres a disclosure if theres a lease with what between metro yes where if somebody owns more than x percent then that has to be disclosed its sort of a similar requirement there with ownership i know that some of these other jurisdictions that weve looked at have done a requirement and and it depends on the percentage so some have done no requirement of this theyre just going to focus on the actual applicant the company and not look behind it to the individuals i think there was one where it became the report that applied only if it was 50 so so that some other jurisdictions had done some other things we could reach out to them and see what theyve done in terms of getting compliance and enforcement of that bill part of the issue was that um on llcs there were entities that were told to keep developing llcs to sort of hide not being able to have to pay their fines when it came to liens by the city and thats not something that i believe is a certainly not an honest thing to do because if you owe the city money and youre a corporation or a big entity building multi-million dollar projects you ought to be able to pay your fines and this way not only that theres no payment arrangements because people have been notorious about getting payment plans but never fulfilling those payment plans and just moving straight on and thats why i think abc and the state building code doesnt one of them does not allow payment plans because people dont stay with their obligations so i madam chair if i can i mean i completely agree that that this something like this section to to prohibit people from getting around this new rule who are individuals who own massive lanes have lots of property uh have been bad actors by getting around that by creating an llc that they own i mean i get all that i understand why i would want to do that im just not exactly sure how this provision works how it would be applied because i dont again this information is not easy to get i dont think the all the ownership of the voting stock of a corporation um so its again its just really a question and maybe something we need to consider as we move forward  But but the way this is written in an incumbent upon the applicant to release that information when they go to get their statements you all would not be doing doing this is my understanding it would be up to omb to sign off on it and the revenue commission is that correct that part goes more towards um once you have the names it would be incumbent on the applicant to go get a certificate of good standing from omb and from with respect to the property taxes so in that sense planning and design would not be doing the verification of that i think the question that councilman hollander is focused in on is we get a list from the applicant saying these are the names how does anybody really verify that part its easy to take those names and go to omb and go on the property taxes and get those certificates of verification but if theres somebody whos been left off for example say they list five people and they really should have listed a six and im just doing this purely for hypothetical not saying that somebody would do that but just if it did how would we someone in government be able to come behind that and catch that and that i think is the the issue that i might want to reach out to some of these other jurisdictions and see and maybe its just under penalty of perjury and if we discover you know theres some sort of consequence but yeah its theres sort of a separation between once you have the names getting those approvals from omb and and the property tax people versus how do you know you have the complete list of names in the first place so i think thats what if i may i think thats one question the other question is um is the idea here that we when you come in to apply for a zoning change were going to ask you lets say youre a youre a corporation were going to ask you is does anybody own 10 percent or more of your corporation if so tell us the names i mean is that what we would do or would we do that would we say if youre a corporation we want to know everybody who owns stock i mean that doesnt for a publicly traded corporation that didnt work very well uh so im im just not exactly sure what the idea would be would the planning commission say you know youre a corporation or youre a partnership or youre an llc so if anybody owns more than 10 of your entity tell us who those people are i just im trying to see how it would work in practice i think there are some options there and i dont know that weve really just gone into the uh specific discussions of them at this point it could be something like that a simple hey you know do you have more than 10 ownership if so please give us those names to check with compliance of this ordinance uh it could be an affidavit that says you know there are no members that have more than 10 control so theres a couple routes that you could go about either requiring those names or at least having people certify that there are no such individuals who might potentially run afoul okay and again i want to be clear id id like the idea of having something that disallows someone who is a bad actor and should not be having a zoning change until they pay their liens and their taxes um not being able to get around that through one of these entities im just trying to see how it works in practice thank you and any changes we make um id like to um make sure that emily lou is involved in because she was involved in this at the beginning before we ever submitted it to granicus to put it on the agenda we ran it by her any of the changes that were made i sent it to her for her her blessing so make sure that if were making changes um were getting close well about 15 more minutes does anybody have any questions or comments before we table this and i might just make one more comment if were if were gonna put the onus on the applicant we might look at amending the language to indicate that because the language right now kind of sounds like it puts the onus on staff to figure that out um yeah because it should be them going to the revenue commission and them going to omb to get right and then we may have more questions on if you know were asking to alter our applications to add a statement or if were look if were supposed to be looking for an extra document to be submitted from the applicant or what that looks like so and i could chime in um ive just pulled up the abc basic application and so theres a section c if youre so if youre applying for an alcohol beverage control license theres a section c that says complete the following for the business proprietor partners and all persons having an interest in the business to be licensed it says if privately held showed 100 of the ownership if publicly traded lists the three highest ranking officers and any natural person who owns 10 or more so theres a sort of a related concept in the alcohol beverage control licensing application process so i dont know if that needs to be put in the ordinance or not if if what youre saying is this could just be if this is the rule that that could be done by the administrative regulation of the planning commission is this is theyre going to change their forms to to flesh out this information thats fine with me if its really im just asking how it works and we can look um between now and the next meeting at the regulations covering abc to see if theres some language that could be adapted to here on the 10 to make it clearer that its the burdens on the applicant and how the information what information would be provided thank you any other questions no one else is in the queue from virtual so um ill entertain a motion to table please probably moved by kevin uh councilman triplett second by councilman george thats what happens when you know people personally so ill entertain a motion to table please probably moved by kevin uh councilman triplett second by councilman george thats what happens when you know people personally so um without objection thatll be tabled until our next committee meeting for more discussion thank you we have no more business in front of this committee today everything else was either held at the request of the sponsor or because

{"text":"The analysis estimates percentage of newly hired employee that is will choose to live in Oakland  the linkage fee analysis determined 40% of new hires would live in Oakland or would if there was affordable housing  so  if this number was increased assuming that all the projects local hires would continue the live in Oakland  the ultimate calculation would lead to - many new housing in Oakland needing affordable House Sog the demand would increase despite what the applicant with the local hire requirement.  The quotation of the applicants relies upon a third assumption which adjusts for potential increase in the labor force but as explained  the impact fee analysis considered all new hires that had previous jobs in Oaklad and determined that they would still generate a demand and a need for new affordable housing  so therefore the 50% local hire requirement does not change the calculations  the justifiable impact fee and so the applicant argues for a reduction that should be based off Ofz the adopted fee and not the maximum justified fee and the linkage analysis so  the O.M.C . also States that a reduction in the fee is only permissible at f the adopted fee is not justified so there was a determination TOF impact fee review board that where theres a reasonable relationship between the the impact fee and the projects demand for affordable housing  it justifies a higher fee that was adopted by Council  so  if we were to apply the maximum justifiable impact fee  it would be $12.85 per square foot.  So  even if the city council accept it is amount cants analysis that a 50% fee reduction is applicable in this case  it would reduce it to 6Z $0.46 per  square foot  we ask you to adopt a resolution Impacting the review boards decision which mean it is Jobs\/Housing fee and the full amount is applicable based on the need for affordable housing generated by this project  the Council can make appropriate findings t Council may have to direct the city administrator to impose a fee in a different amount Tha  concludes my presentation and happy to answer any questions.
