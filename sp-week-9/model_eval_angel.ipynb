We see these examples of culture and art manifest in beautiful ways in every corner of Oakland but we entrepreneurs condition do this when there are decades of Disinvestment and discriminatory policies. Small businesses are a natural entry point for the city of Oakland to bolster economic security, it is clear that racial inequality is tied closely with geography in Oakland, it is clear that the city of Oakland lacks the tools necessary to provide essentially services and resources to the small business owners and entrepreneurs of Oakland who need it the most especially now.
