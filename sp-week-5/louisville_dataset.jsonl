{"text":"This data today marijuana is the interesting one that i use in my class quite a bit data shows that white people and black people use marijuana at the same rates but in some jurisdictions in some locales you can see people incarcerated if theyre black up to 10 times as often as white americans the disparity exists whether marijuana is legal or whether its illegal and its worsened in some places since marijuana has been legalized still more likely to be arrested even where its legal it this section of arrests represents 6 million people between 2010 and 2018 all right so now some data specific to kentucky which is drawn from the sources ive already shown you the incarceration rate in kentucky per 100 000 people you can see the data right right there for black kentuckians its 1400 for white kentuckians its 430 whereas the state average about the same for incarceration of black americans a little bit different for white americans but the disparity still exists in terms of who we incarcerate in this nation and who we incarcerate in kentucky data on juvenile incarceration is not much better although overall juveniles are being sent to incarceration less and less often black children are about more than four times likely to be detained and the sentencing project has kentuckys rates here available as well about 4.4 times more often for black children to be incarcerated than white children between 2015 and 2019 youll also see that some of this data is a little bit outdated and thats a thats a product of how we collect it were also going to theres also evidence in here about what we call the snowball effect about inequity begetting inequity everything works together to end up with inequity in the criminal justice system whether  Its poverty whether its whether you make bail or not whether its what youre charged with whether the police are in your neighborhood at all to begin with its a snowball effect and when inequity starts the beginning it continues later on in life and later on in society and we can see that with poverty we can see that with sexual assault we can see that with systems contacts with foster children we can see incarceration correlated with illiteracy poverty mental illness substance abuse and victimization as well when i was a young prosecutor i had and this is just kind of an anecdote about the system and how victims end up being perpetrators at some point the worst case i ever got was what was the case they gave me day one and it was a very involved sexual assault case with 11 children and three adults all of the children they they lived in poverty poverty and there was illiteracy in the family and the um little eight-year-old girl was the only one able to testify the other children were either too young or too emotionally damaged they it was a horribly sad case an eight-year-old had visited her home multiple times i had a rapport with her i had a i had a an old hyundai at the time and i drove it in and she was just so impressed that i had this really nice car and it was a way for me to have this this rapport with her and i just remember her being a very beautiful little girl her case didnt end up well because there was some witness tampering that happened and she got to the preliminary hearing and she was doing this back and forth and so we didnt end up mounting a successful prosecution and the next time i saw her was in juvenile court a few years ago where she was a 15 year old defendant and at that point she had not done anything significant it was a misdemeanor but she um she ran up to me and i was still a prosecutor at the time but kids dont know the difference and she ran up to me she said my lawyers here everythings going to be fine now and i wish that that were the case but it kind of illustrates how victims of an of inadequacy victims of poverty victims of racism end up in the system like a snowball and thats what happened to her because the intervention didnt work we couldnt keep her away from her parents legally speaking in that particular case and its one of the saddest cases ive ever had in my entire life but its why i feel um passionate about this center for american progress has another uh kind of lengthy report on this issue and they talk in depth about the snowball effects i dont think they call it that um but its a report about how to advance criminal justice beyond the department of justice why because what affects this are these things like poverty and illiteracy um they dont talk about vaccination rates but but certainly that would have some impact uh on on um you know like life in general and so they talk about how we have the the uh school to prison pipeline and we have um this is just a really nice in-depth article about things that are beyond the criminal justice system that we can change that be that might be more within the power of louisville council to address okay  Many of the best initiatives to fix the criminal justice system are statewide or nationwide one of the things so when i crowdsourced this of course i have friends who are lawyers i have friends who are students i have friends who are social workers and they had great ideas many of which were were not relevant to metro council um and thats great uh would i like to end sovereign immunity yes thats not something that we can do at a local level there are laws in kentucky that protect the police on a statewide level um like a 48 hour waiting period to interrogate a police officer accused of a crime um that the the fop lawyer has to be present things like that um the statutory exclusion in kentucky for jury service by felons were going to get to jury service in a minute but that isnt something that a local body can legislate against because specifically the legislation says so other great solutions rely on cooperation with other agencies and if thats a possibility for this governing body it would be among some of the most effective things that you can do local law enforcement the bar the bench corrections other city agencies crisis intervention teams law enforcement policy and training all  Of these things are if the council wanted to do something on an interdisciplinary basis would be effective have been effective other places and thats where were getting to now so your history lesson is over for now um and thats the the data that that shows the disparity and where it lies in kentucky and all of that the rest of this presentation is designed to give you some ideas about what council might do um understanding that the power is certainly limited this is not in a great place in my presentation but if you havent heard about it i wanted to know about it and i also wanted to ask you a question about it its an initiative a recent one about from uofl and spalding to allow mental health workers and social workers to respond to some 911 calls it said it was funded by louisville metro and im not sure what agency funded it is that something thats been through council or is it a city office im not sure this is an example of how um agencies can work together and certainly youd have to get law enforcement in on this initiative if it were um to to ever be enacted at a large scale um but this is an example of a project thats going on right now thats something louisville metro council could support if they if they wanted to um do you know if this report has been presented already the funding was approved in this past budget so its in the mayors office or is it lmpd budget lmpd budget so we funded it and so we support the initiative moving forward okay um when i looked at this and when i looked at the use of force ordinance that was passed back in october 2020 my first thought was if council wants to get involved in criminal justice reform there needs to be a data gathering component to it so if there isnt already in this funded initiative which does sound very interdisciplinary if there could be data collection involved how many reports are are issued how many do the police just respond to or does this task force respond to what are the outcomes do you know if thats part of what theyre doing or is it still in the developmental stages its developmental stage i dont believe when we funded it that we had any criteria uh so thats all going to be developed fantastic and certainly we will require those types of reports those types of reports are one of the best things that a local government can do because the legislature in the state isnt going to do anything without data and its arguable whether you know other things could be accomplished through data other interdisciplinary measures okay heres some examples of what has worked elsewhere in terms of local government policies or or initiatives relative to criminal justice reform some of these and ive got a couple of slides worth of them are through collaboration with other agencies and some are not save our streets is an interesting initiative responding to gun violence in brooklyn and the bronx and they use what they call violence interrupters who are citizens who respond and theyre seeing a 20 reduction in gun violence when this program happens uh they hold community events they mediate conflicts its a massive undertaking but it is something that council could support um if there was uh interest in funding it and getting it off the ground i tried not to include anything that didnt have data points on on efficacy for you uh and this is the group that that runs the program the center for court innovation um another area that has worked elsewhere is uh reforming diversion so if you get arrested on a crime diversion can put you on probation make you uh do the right things for the justice system and that charge is dismissed later on diversion is statutory with several crimes in kentucky but in this particular jurisdiction in santa barbara there was an initiative done through the prosecutors office to increase the amount of diversion that was done to divert more low-level offenders from the criminal justice system into cost-effective alternatives because it isnt just about reforming the system a lot of people are concerned about the cost many of these initiatives save cost by not incarcerating people we are not paying to incarcerate people that this is another this is one of those initiatives so if the prosecutors office could be involved in increasing diversion having a program where diversion is automatic or where we divert more crimes then we keep more people out of custody and we pay less for their incarceration there is a momentum and theres a little data on both sides about college educated police officers theres supreme court decisions that say um its an interesting one there were a couple of applicants on a police um entrance exam that scored so high the police didnt want them and so they fought constitutionally for the right to be police officers and that particular jurisdiction did not want college educated police officers because they thought that they would use maybe delicate here they thought that they would think on their own too much they would make their own decisions using discretion as opposed to following public policy if you are concerned with police using their discretion in a good way there are some studies that show college educated police officers are less likely to use force then they may be more likely to arrest for less serious crimes but only if that gets them a promotion if promotions are based on things like community engagement then that doesnt happen statistically and theres data in these studies to show you that thats not the case and thats not the case for data in these studies to show you that and whether thats something that the council could have an initiative through with jctc or some other providers of college degrees even if its as far as the last i recall uh lmpd im not sure if they required a two-year degree or if they already do they dont some large metro police departments do that i thought i had read that ive been teaching long enough where maybe have changed through the years okay thank you um so thats something that the council could encourage i dont know by ordinance if it could be a an initiative with jctc i know jctc also runs uh free programs for uh people im not sure what the criteria is i know at my community college there are lots of um programs that we allow students to take classes for free and if we can get more people degrees without getting into debt and then that benefits the criminal justice system by providing officers who are less likely to use force thats a win-win i put this in here um this oregon guide to local reform if you are interested in figuring out what works best for louisville this is not necessarily specific to oregon but theres like a checklist so if you are interested in what might work here you take the issue and you put it in its kind of like a spreadsheet kind of like a um well ill show you again brevity not being my strong suit im running out on time so i the article from the oregon justice resource center is about disrupting mass incarceration at the local level and theres a guide you can download but it shows you all the people that make an impact on this and theres a big list of them here some of them you might be able to to work with and some of them you might not but theres in this guide a worksheet heres the issue assessment worksheet that you can put in an issue and it will tell you who is in charge of what and its a nice way to organize things that youre interested in making a difference about this is just another slide about other agencies from an organization called justice matters this is faith-based but a lot of what they uh rely on is certainly data run this has local um initiatives from all across the country and how they have worked uh through their their local agencies uh to change the system a program called lead uh saw an 87 percent reduction in incarceration and 39 fewer days in jail that was like a diversion program that was multidisciplinary another diversion program saved five million in jail costs theres an interesting example in that justice matters handout about a neighborhood court staffed by community volunteers so for the right level of offense you and some places have done teen courts which is a similar um a similar initiative your neighborhood dispute your low level citation style crime might be decided by community members would you get a would you get a fairer shot would you would you have a more involved community if we had initiatives like this you could read a little bit more about that in that handout and theres a couple of more oh a court date reminder system is another one that they pointed to how many people miss their court date because they are they dont keep up with their court dates well i had three different calendar reminders for today and i would not have missed it for the world but um people struggle for reasons that are beyond their own control and so if we can have a court date reminder system that uses text and email and a family members email what have you we can decrease failures to appear we can decrease court costs because every time that person has to come back up they get arrested for failure to appear were going to pay money to incarcerate them a couple times were going to pay money again to see them in court and they just the costs multiply lets get past this because i want to get to the options that may work in louisville and this is where im headed these are in order of easiness to most to most difficulty but theyre also in order of efficacy louisville  Has a ban the box ordinance and the ban the box ordinance is about um not taking someones criminal history into account in terms of hiring them this is where the disparity is people with criminal records are disproportionately affected if they are also black and thats just a little uh graphic on that but the current ordinance involves two separate areas of hiring one is in city hiring and the ban the box ordinance does not allow for the city to taking into account criminal history until later on in the process and then and if you read the news articles on louisvilles ban the box ordinance they will say that the ordinance does not allow vendors for the city to use criminal record but what the actual words of the ordinance are is that they prefer not to use those vendors and so thats that preference and im not sure what the data is on on vendors that that have contracts with the city and how many of them use criminal history in terms of hiring and and there are exceptions if youre handling money if youre involved with children background checks are um okay under the under the ordinance and so ive so the city prefers to do business with vendors have adopted this policy it would not be difficult and theres bipartisan support for these ban the box movements for louisville to update this ordinance uh its a 2014 ordinance um weve seen changes in marijuana laws since then but the the ordinance hasnt been updated to make it more strong strong make it stronger sorry and i want you to see this compared with chicagos ordinance theres a ban the box group that you can go online and look at all the laws by state Chicagos ordinance is a lot stronger and it applies to any businesses that are doing uh business in the city of Chicago thats something that that Louisville can handle with an ordinance if youre interested in impacting the way a criminal history impacts people and their their their their job opportunities updating that ordinance is a is a fairly straightforward way that you would need no no interaction with another city agency no buy-in really from anyone else in order to change that another one is cash bail your options may be limited here because of the state statutes on cash bail but cash bail is a huge issue in criminal justice reform so a lot of people are talking about it now if i in my position of privilege get arrested for a dui i will have almost no consequences because i will bond myself out or get somebody to bond me out because i have the cash to do that with cash bail either with the full bail amount or ten percent to a bondsman i show back up to work on monday i take pto for my court date im good someone else who does not have the money to pay cash bail will sit in jail until they get to their trial date if they even have to sit a few days on um i when ive written on this example i use dui but dui is statutorily a little bit different in kentucky than other k than other crimes i wrote an article about this after some of the protesters were arrested after the breanna taylor demonstrations and thats i think a better example so if i get arrested for a low-level crime and i cant make my bail on a friday night um i dont see a judge until monday and theres a 48-hour window and monday i dont show up to work and i cant call and i lose my job and maybe i lose my housing and so the thats where that snowball comes into play and so cash bail is a is a big area of change upwards of 60 of people who are held in jail are there not because they are serving a sentence but because they cannot afford to make their cash bail um the courier journal did a study on it a few years ago its not its not quite uh as new as i would like it but its its included there um and what happens to people who cannot make their cash bail can be significant if youve if youve heard of uh khalif browder theres a documentary on his case i havent seen it yet young man arrested for allegedly stealing a backpack could not make bail went to rikers island for three years pending his case they dropped the charges he was released and committed suicide because of the situation when you cannot make your bail and for a lot of these reforms were not talking about violent offenses were not talking about people who if we released them they would necessarily be a threat were talking about even lower level offenses for kaliefs case it was stealing a backpack and ultimately they they didnt believe he actually even did that and so some of these cash bail alternatives and as i understand it louisville has a pretrial services program that is statutory were all skip past this because youll have a copy of this about the inequities in pretrial uh confinement based on race and poverty so kentucky has this administrative release program that allows for pretrial services to administratively release people before they even see a judge for non-violent non-sexual misdemeanors only section 4 allows localities to add class d felonies i called pretrial services today and someone did say yes you can get it on a felony but i was not able to put my hands on the paperwork so we may be doing this already in louisville but could this be expanded could the reach of pretrial services or pretrial release be something that could go beyond non-violent non-sexual misdemeanors could we not only that but how many people when this happens with this administrative process happens theres a checklist of factors and the checklist determines whether or not you qualify for pretrial release how could that be expanded could that be expanded through the use of the prosecutors office to administratively allow for release before bond determination thats whats happening in some other states there are reforms to the judiciary in some other states and the data shows that when weve expanded when weve decreased cash bail when weve expanded allowing people to go home pending their court dates crime does not rise it also shows a significant cost savings because if im not incarcerating you prior to your case you are paying to house yourself the state is not so thats thats another benefit as well im gonna im gonna go quickly through these because the best one have i run out of time councilwoman okay im gonna go past expungement then and go right to data collection then the last part is on implicit bias training very briefly probably the single most important thing a local government can do is collect data that was the number one response i got if you do research that is the number one response across the country where data is lacking we currently track data terribly across this country we we use inaccurate and out of date sources for that one of the things that metro government could do this is just uh kind of showing you how data collection it doesnt work well is do an inmate survey if council is concerned about lets say uh uh conditions in the jail theres the something called the national inmate survey that the government used to do years ago the latest data is about a decade old and it was designed to track sexual assault every time you see one of these click links in here you can actually see copies on the websites of surveys that were used nationwide if thats something council wants to do to track inmate abuses to track conditions in the in the jail thats certainly not a very difficult thing to accomplish could we be collecting data in the court system could there be the the the colleague of mine that works for the habeas corpus research council used to be in the department of public advocacy the first thing she said is i want every judge to have a bubble sheet i want to know the demographics and i want to know the arrest i want to know everything about this person when this person gets sentenced and if the court or the public defender could have a bubble sheet that would track the data of the demographics based on arrest based on what was charged and what was pled or what was charged and what was convicted what the sentence was then we would have some good data about locally where is the disparity and what is the disparity and how much disparity do we have but that local data is a piece that is missing and there are people who can help you write that bubble sheet there are examples and what ive given you on um those i think she suggested the judge but im not sure how if all of the bench would be amenable to that certainly the defense bar would be and it wouldnt be terribly difficult to get that accomplished to get the to get the data for you and it could also be part of the use of force ordinance the last thing that i wanted to briefly talk about is implicit bias this is another very emerging area of the law where were training judges were training court staff potentially jurors about what our implicit biases are if youve never taken an implicit bias test its very interesting and you can see them here at project implicit its a its a timed test and it has you associate good and bad words with categories so like woman and man beautiful smart intelligent how fast does your brain associate that with woman versus how fast is it associated with man and theres all different kinds of um those tests what i like about it is that everyone has an implicit bias and everyone has biases for and against certain categories if you dont know what yours are you cant work against it and theres training um and and theres lots of training for judges for prosecutors for law enforcement on how to acknowledge your implicit biases how to get past them i think the tests are kind of fun and i like knowing where my biases are
