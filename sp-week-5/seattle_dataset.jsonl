However  from my understanding  having collaborated with a number of other architects who go through this process  it seems like the process for administrative design review can be just as long  if not longer  than a full design review.  And so because of the concern and need for housing  both outside of this crisis as well as during it  I think its important to exempt this and prioritize affordable housing and publicly funded housing for those who need it most.

The central staff have been willing to make themselves available and at the ready to craft amendments over the weekends and on nights  and in direct opposition to the public comment that we heard this morning  no worker should have to do that.  Every worker deserves rest and time to be with their family and community  and that is especially true from a body who constantly tries to lift up the work of workers in every industry  and Im glad that were able to move forward with this amendment today.  In light of the accusations and mischaracterization that I heard in my committee yesterday as it related to central staff as well  I wanted to make sure to take this opportunity to just thank central staff for all of the work that they do over the weekend and recognize that this amendment expands beyond our policy work  and it really  I think  is going to be a level of good workplace balance  work-life balance for everyone involved  so thank you to central staff  to the clerks who are on the line here  to IT  to the communications team  and to Seattle Channel  who all work to make sure that were delivering our deliberations in a public way on Monday  but very happy that this will not be the norm going forward and very much look forward myself to more work-life balance for everyone with this amendment.

Correct.  It assumes that with the veto override that sections 2 and 4 in council bill 119812 would be incorporated after the override and so you would be amending the bill to reinsert them.  So it will appear that the appropriations table that is currently in section 2 of 119812 is struck entirely and a new appropriations table that is just spending $57 million would be incorporated versus what I distributed this year.

An even larger number  $231 million of difference between budgeted expenditures and actuals  so this means the city spent $231 million less than was projected in 2021.  Now  there are a number of reasons for that  and part of it is that prior obligations  commitments that are either legal or contractual in nature or Council priorities were not fully completed in 2021  though the intent is to complete those.  And so these will be covered in an upcoming Council Bill  Council Bill 120316  which will actually be with the Finance and Housing Committee at the next meeting on May 17th.  Well detail this information for you  but for the purposes of the plan  what we have done is said a portion of the money that is available at the end of 2021 is going to be carried over into 2022  and theres a few different types of carry-forwards  automatic ones that have like specifically prior approval by Council to carry in the future years  and then legislative ones  which are ones that are part of that bill I referenced that will be submitted as a request to carry forward.","meta":{"muni":"seattle","session_id":"f7617137b38b"}}

So the number 19 is listed in the memo and is a potential amendment that would request that the OLS director develop and present proposed rules to council before passage of the legislation.  Under the Seattle Municipal Code  the OLS director has the authority to issue rules as deemed necessary to carry out the functions of the department.  And in addition to this general authority  the proposed ordinance also specifically mandates or allows for the OLS director to conduct rulemaking to refine and clarify certain aspects of the bill.  My understanding is that council members may have concerns with invoking this authority  and the options as listed in the memo include to postpone the vote on the bill until proposed rules are provided by the OLS director  to not postpone the vote  but request that the OLS director develop rules and provide them to the committee before the effective date and to take no action  to not postpone or request those proposed rules.","meta":{"muni":"seattle","session_id":"d739692ad12f"}}

It seemed like the next step to evolve our association to something that was more sustainable  that would support the small businesses and also engage the larger property owners in our neighborhood.  Weve seen successful models around the city that are really encouraging  and it looks like a great model for community collaboration.  It also gives us access to grants  potentially with a part time employee that can help us apply to them and a point of contact for the city thats more formal.  Weve been told directly from many different city members that we really love to coordinate with BIAs  that thats a clear way to connect with neighborhoods.","meta":{"muni":"seattle","session_id":"5498bc14c946"}}

So just to put a finer point on that  as folks can see in the legislation in front of us  also in the findings  when we hear that drivers are making around $21.50  $21.53 is the dollar amount that weve been looking at per hour.  The reality is that the drivers are often taking home about $9.73 per hour.  Put that in contrast with what our citys minimum wage is  somewhere between $13.50 to $16.39.  And I think it puts in stark contrast the wage disparity that many of these drivers currently have.","meta":{"muni":"seattle","session_id":"a634ac8a9e32"}}

{"text":"What does that mean?  I would say that the answer is year by year  the funds are fed by resources  revenues  in most cases  as I mentioned in my prepared remarks  we are talking about property taxes coming in generally in April and October.  The annual budget authorizes spending to happen out of these funds  so there can never be more spending than there is money on hand to spend.  The year-end fund balance is a straightforward difference between the revenues that are coming in the door and the anticipated spending and authorized spending that is allowed from each of the funds.  So by near-term  I guess for 2020  I mean between today and the end of 2020.","meta":{"muni":"seattle","session_id":"b1f3bc99fdc9"}}

So on this slide  Dan  I understand the concept that youre describing  which is that its pretty  inter-fund loans is a common concept  and by definition allows us to use existing revenue sources and streams to pay for other services on the promise that well pay these back.  So its giving ourselves a credit card and then paying back on that credit.  So in these cases  however  on the seawall replacement  affordable housing  Mercer West  waterfront lid  and a short-term rental tax  while I understand that we have borrowed against ourselves for other purposes  I guess what Im asking is what details can you provide us right now about how those dollars were used?

I  Dont believe we have anything pending for folks who are working in early childhood education. They  Are not funded through the human services department.

We were very favorable and fans of the stay healthy streets and theres been a lot of conversation about how do we keep them permanent while also still expanding our network throughout the city.  As for investments in Roosevelt  I have to admit that I feel very fortunate because theres been some really large investments that have happened in the neighborhood and then are currently underway.  For example  65th that goes right in front of the light rail station and is the main east-west thoroughfare in Roosevelt.  I dont know if its part of the safety program  but they added bike lanes but also narrowed the streets and added parking so the traffic basically just slowed down.","meta":{"muni":"seattle","session_id":"822135139080"}}

What we learned in that meeting is that  the counties receiving anywhere from 12 000 to 73 000 doses per week.  Its really fluctuating  and that range makes it really hard for our public health workers to anticipate how many Vaccinations they will be able to do in any given week  in any given day.  It also makes it really hard to schedule staff  to schedule appointments  so this is kind of what happens when we dont have an actual plan for how to Rollout a vaccine  but Thankfully now we will be Ramping up production  president Biden has indicated that he  while he has invoked the defense production act  so we may be getting more supply  more vaccines  all of that should become more Predicable over time.

Both law and also the interim advisory board have also recommended that the exact process for selecting the board appointment seats be kept flexible to allow the EDI to develop best practices that will be useful for increasing representation on the board.
