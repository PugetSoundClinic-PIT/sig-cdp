The outcome  we expect the s the access to Lake Merritt will be well managed without extraordinary City resources or police presence while also ` generating revenue that can support park maintenance city-wide.  I want to remind you that the working group that we have consists of the city administrators office  both Council offices that represent the Lake  Opryd  public works  DOT  race and equity  fire Department  police Department  economic workforce development and I say this because when we reviewed and considered this proposal to you  we had unanimous support from the departments that were at the table  this was a team effort and I wanted to make that really clear.  This is based on the past few years of attempting to manage the growing crowds at the Lake during warm weather and with the effects of climate change  the warm weather has been more and more common and we see more and more weekends with large crowds.  Some of the past problems  I think this photograph Depicts it well  in 2020  without an enforcement presence  weekend crowds caused significant traffic safety issues and this is a shot of Lakeshore  as you can see  theres--I dont even know thousand call it  quadruple parking  every Lane is parked  the bike Lane is blocked  I have bias led through there and came into contact with vehicles  it was very unsafe  this is a view of that same area from - Lakeshore trying to drive in a car  you can see this bicyclist is very wedged in between parked cars and vehicles in a really unsafe manner  so past response  the city working group closed Lakeshore southbound to all traffic  we blocked El Embarcadero  we restricted parking on Bellevue between Perkins and grand  we prohibited parking on the Lakeside of the street.","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"363760c5a501"}}

One  you know  both you and Councilmember Fife mentioned the need to try to figure out a way to collect equity data and racial data and that will be very easy to do  it will be optional  it would have to be optional because thats--theres certain fair housing laws and things like that  but they would be--we could design a feature where when you log in to the system to use it as a property owner or a tenant  you also are asked a few optional questions and we can work with the Department of race and equity to sort of design that survey  so to speak  or the optional kind of data or questionnaire  weve had very good success with that kind of a partnership in the past with our--we have a new client management system we created that also collects that information  we have that in our intake form that is we work with Department of race and equity to include those type of questions and in a way where it would solicit participation  so the features piece  it is pretty--the way the process works  its hard coated that we would have to come to the Council to approve a contract  any contract before we engage  we would do an Rfp process  make a selection and draft a contract that you have to approve of.  That contract will list out the features  and so if that will be an opportunity  weve taken note of your feedback today and that would be an additional opportunity to include if something has been omitted or if you think of something in the interim to include that feature if possible under the price point that we have outlined and budgeted for the rent Registry.  But this certainly is a feature we can easily incorporate into the design and then the substantial compliance piece  I think that it would be probably important to--if we move--if you decide to move this to Council to submit an amendment that clearly directs the rent board to Promulgate regulations  to Promulgate a regulation on substantial compliance.","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"7e763f5d9e2c"}}

Its going to have a big impact to reduce violent crime and improve the quality of life  our measurement opportunities Sxits going to be our feedback  its difficult to measure the fear of crime  but the feedback we get from the community members about walking in the community is not safe  I think to gauge this is to hear from them if they feel safer in the community  I feel if we continue this approach  the data will prove that it will work  to cut those robberies in half is my goal  its a wishful goal but I think it can be accomplished  so area 3Finger Im confident were Foing the take a good approach and engage with the community   Thank you.","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"fc7cd4546233"}}

And then in October when we had a conversation as a full Council  there was some direction that we gave to the Mayoral administration and to the staff  that included launching a Co-Governed encampment pilot by February  it also included identifying a site in each of our districts that we could use for homeless solutions and shelter and that is something thats really important in terms of combining back to us to hear what is happening.  My office  for example  is very  very interested in having a Co-Governed encampment in my district and theres a number of potential sites.  We have service providers ready to go  we have at least two shelter provide Hoarser are ready to go and we need the city administration to support us in making this happen and to move with the urgency that I think were all feeling.  And just to give some of my colleagues a sense of the scale that we could potentially achieve  I think many of you are familiar with the East 12th Street parcel in my district  its right across from the Lake and right by the Henry Kaiser auditorium  Im incredibly frustrated that that site has been undeveloped for so long and that the homeless encampment there is Growng and has become more dangerous when we could immediately use that for interim Shelt and - her housing for people  and - some of you know some of the - various companies that are doing amazing work across the country providing shelter and shelter that has power and running water which is something that has been lacking in the community cabins for example  so for that parcel at East 12th Street and Lake Merritt Boulevard  we have a proposal that could place 179 shelters there  two people each if the people are related Toeach other or know each other  so thats a sense of the scale that we could potentially get to versus some of the other options that were currently funding and we need to see those options as were making decisions on this money.","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"f93138cb7beb"}}

Secondly  it was announced it would be the Department conducting that investigation  that should be independent and so I wanted to make sure that that investigation would be taking place independently such as through Sipra and also whether theres an attempt to discern improper conduct actions  attitudes or posts from officers without them being ones that are reported on by reporters  is there a Proactive effort to identify them  for example  someone - has reported Geotag information from right wing site that is could be looked at that could also be relevant and then  Lastly  I think as this comes back  it will be important to hear more about where and how recruiting and hiring is taking place and what changes to the recruitment methods and the recruitment targets is being done in order to Akhao Efz these--achieve ` these goals.

So  we Aleady have an allowance to allow people to take advantage of the density bonus by providing moderate income rental units but its in a different section of the municipal code under section 15 as opposed to--or Chapter 15 as opposed to chapter 17 of the planning code.  We also have in our application for the density bonus a reference to that section in the affordable housing impact fee about being able to take advantage of the density bonus with market rate or sorry  moderate income rental units  - but we could if the Council wanted  you know  to look at for clarity sake  maybe adding something to the density bonus chapter so people maybe dont Miss that as an option  so that is something Tha could be done.  - for the--lets see  the like for like replacement  I think we did talk about last time that we have the similar number of bedrooms  we do not have currently the same square footage  we do also have in the the density bonus under 17.107.105  talking about the quality of the target living units so thats when youre bidding a mixture of both affordable Yaoutsbacker units and market rate unit INS a Prorkt project  it talks about that the floor area number of bedrooms and amenities such as bedrooms or such as bathroom Rkts fig Hurst  alliances  location and utilities of the targeted living units shall be slumber stash equal in size and quality of those of the market rate units.  Tenant households in the targeted living units should are the same Ak says as the housing development service and is facilities as tenant housing units in the tenant rate units and they should be evenly distributed throughout the residential housing development and they shall be Curtsied concurrent with them prior to the the construction of the market phase  so that is something thats in there in general that the affordable units should be essentially equal and equivalent to the standards of the market rate units in the same development but that does not address the issue of being the exact same square footage if youre replacing any units that have been demolished  so that is currently not in there.","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"8cdba4bbe55e"}}

{"text":"Absolutely  so  chair public safety Committee  city staff  members of the public  youll recall when the police Commission first got started  there were obstacles to them being truly independent and getting the adequate resources they needed  one obstacle was the inability to directly hire an Inspector Jeb or an attorney that reported to them and not to others such as the city administrator  and there was concern about conflicting direction or Ulterior motives  then I brought forward the prior ordinance were--the changes that were amending or proposing to amend and thats what granted the police Commission the ability and independence and autonomy to contract directly for their own professional services and including the inspector general and to secure their own personnel resources  this - was prior to the ballot measure that we recently adopted last year as well.  So  the order--whats Beig proposed is cleanup legislation to clarify as director Alden mentioned  the legislative intent of the prior ordinance and really improving the efficiency for police Commission so when they want to contract with someone or an entity for less than 50 thousand dollars  they can in fact bypass the lengthy Rfp process similar to how the city administrator can do so outside of the police Commissions procurement authority.  So  thats the goal  I want to just acknowledge the city attorney team for helping us navigate the path to bring - this and then director Alden and of course our volunteer police Commission for their tireless work on behalf of Oakland residents overseeing this--the police Department.

The first question is whether the city of Oakland already funds the services and programs included in the Emerald new deal  the second being whether there be any overlap between the new proposed Planing and oversight Commission and the citys existing commissions and Lastly the fiscal impact of the Emerald new deal  so Ill touch on the first two questions and I was going to offer director Roseman with our Finance director to speak on the fiscal impact and then I can also highlight a couple of alternative options we included in supplemental report for the city councils consideration.  So  with respect to the first question  whether the city funds the services and programs included in the Emerald new deal  we broke down in the report the three different categories with the - Emerald new deal prescribes for the Cannabis tax revenue  so the first being 15% on the citys cost of administering the Emerald new deal  the second being up to 35% going towards existing city of Oakland programs and departments that support individuals disproportionately impacted by--and neighborhood disproportionately impacted by the war on drugs and Lastly  category 3 which is up to 50% of the funding going towards external organizations to provide services to those disproportionately impacted by the war on drugs  so in terms of the first category  these would be all new costs the city isnt currently tracked the use of the Cannabis use revenues as theyre deposited in the general Fund and the new planning and oversight Commission as its currently defined would--and the different responsibilities would include producing certain reports like the impact on the war on drugs  a plan for using the Cannabis tax revenues  audits on the use of those funds  Rfps for those external organizations for this use of Cannabis tax revenues  those would all be new function and is would require new staff to implement.","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"7e763f5d9e2c"}}

I do want the hear from my colleague  Councilmember Fife  but for the sake of conversation  I think its important to keep this item - in committee because I believe that we need to see some concrete information to evaluate our existing interventions and we also need to see some proposals for the types of interventions that we have already given direction about and for now  I think I will make a motion for this to come back to committee with the evaluation report as well as with proposals on the Co-Governed encampment  the sites in each district  this is again using public land or public buildings for homeless solutions  and also a proposal for using hotels and motels using FEMA reimbursement  and I think we have to set some numbers to this  you know  and Im not sure if this is the right number  but hearing that San Francisco is housing 2200 residents  for Oakland  I would like to put out there a proposal for using the FEMA reimbursements to house Unthousand unsheltered residents  and Ill leave it at that for now  thank you.","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"f93138cb7beb"}}

{"text":"When speeds are cut in half to 20 miles per hour  the safety impacts are exponential  9 out of 10 people survive that crash  however  one out of 10 are still killed.  When in Oik land about 25% of all of our traffic deaths are related to speed as the primary cause and speed has a secondary factor on many different types of crashes as well  so as we--I want to provide a quick summary of our Sos Mish Ghtve--initiative which really focused on looking at all of the different types of traffic safety approaches and measuring those and evaluating them to make sure--to identify the strategies that are the most effective so we could spend City Resources time and money most efficiently but also look at the equity Impacters and look - for opportunities to advance equity and understand and be transparent about any efforts that might negatively impact equity and think through whether or not there are mitigation available.  And Im not going to go through all of this today  but I want to highlight that - todays informational report really focuses on advancing our policy goals around a focus on speed related policies.  So  through our Sos efficacy and equity analysis  we found that lowering speed limits does help reduce speeding  both in Portland  Oregon  and in Seattle  Washington recently  these cities lowered speed limit and is measured their impact  they didnt add additional enforcement or infrastructure change  they ordered their speed limit  they wanted to know what the factor was in that  there were certainly measurable decreases in speeding  but I think whats most exciting and most significant is that they saw decreases in excessive speeding in the most dangerous Speeders  if you recall that graphic that I showed at the start  its those egregious Speeders that are the ones most likely to cause severe and fatal crashes so that is significant  in see a lt  they measured 22% reduction in crashes and Californias zero traffic fatalities task force conducted a research Sips Sis that was led by the University of KOL foreign ya Institute of transportation - studies and in that report  they discussed that reducing speed limits almost universally reduces speeds  so this work is important.  Ryan stole my thunder on the - 85th Percentile  since its so confusing  aisle say it - again  the 85th Percentile is required for setting speed limits in California  its required for setting speed limits in most state INS the United States  this isnt something thats universal - across the world  other countries use other practices bunter Hao er in Cal Flopper ya  we use the 85th Percentile  through that approach  speed limits are set by driver behavior rather than whats safe for conditions in other countries  examples are whats the roadway design  what are the land uses  who are the users of that roadway and how many people are expected to be around and thats how speed limits are set.","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"270600240eaf"}}

First of all  we only received two bids for this particular Sanitary sewer project Andin the past  that case  and we over 90% of the Sanitary sewer Rehab work were performed by the two contractors in the the city and we are submitting information or a report to the public works Committee in the coming May and we will provide more details about the contractor pool and also provide a history of the bid in the last ten years but overall  the city has this 50% of the local business requirements with 2525% of them to the small and very small business enterprise.  And the sewer rehabilitation work especially at a scale of the sub Basin level requires heavy equipment and NR the city of Oakland in the past  we only have these two contractors qualified to submit their bids and for the public outreach  or the due process in our solicitation and reach out to the contractors and even talk to the--some of the smaller businesses but given the magnitude of the work which is usually around three to five million dollars price tag of this sewer project and the possibility we havent received more than two bids in the past.

So  cares act funding  a question has come up about cares act  the stimulus fund thing city has already received and we wanted to make sure we Adrez its in this presentation  the city was awarded 36.99 million dollars in cares act  weve been reporting out on that at the city council pretty much every nearly city council meeting since we received the money  26.9 million of that was dedicated to external community programming grants and grants and approximately 10 million of that was kept in-house for internal city Covid costs.  Another question has been asked about our FEMA money  the citys Mid-Cycle adopted budget assumed 3.6 million dollars in FEMA reimbursements in the current fiscal year but thats just an assumption  the receipt of this revenue is speculative and uncertain  we are hope Tog get it but it should not be counted on at this point until we have a better understanding of whether or not that will come in.","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"bf4d837f0200"}}

I just point out to members what you already know which is there are a lot of interactions between the community and the port  we work very  very hard at the port  tenants  the port itself  customers and making sure we are minimizing those impacts.  As weve looked forward at this in the context of other projects  you are also very aware of  it serves a reminder that we need to be very careful about citing high density and new residential areas right next to operational areas  Resiting of 880 to its present location included the construction of frontage road specifically to accommodate truck and is to move those trucks in operations close tore the port and away from the community  that Predated the new residential construction  obviously those - need to be balanced  we think the staff and port have done a good job of doing those things in their proposal to you today.

You were Eloqent in your if I could add anything more to that which you are correct  we have to Prioritize the resources we have to focus on those high injury networks and  Just through the chair  just to add on top of that  so I think what I was--and absolutely  we have to Prioritize those high injury areas.  When I talk about the plan B  right  like can we say for instance  us as Councilmembers  I understand we work off of the data and we must do that but I also believe Ifup of an area that is at high risk of potentially killing someone that we should also implement Preventative measures so we dont have to collect the data of someone being hit or the Dataof someone being killed  so  as Councilmembers on the ground  we really do work with our communities  so like understanding that we only have so much capacity  is there a plan B in regards to  Okay  well  we know that many cars are speeding here Televisings a school or a Daycare in this area  we know we cant get to this space because we havent had that data yet and theres ten other places in the city that we need to get to  like  is there a plan B of how--going out there and seeing what kind of environmental--temporary environmental changes we can make while were waiting to come to this  right  some quick changes like implementing a stop sign  right  something that is lower cost  just for the time being  I mean  the point of this is--I wants just not about the areas--where we are see thing most people getting hit or killed or injured but its also about the Preventative as well too  while were wait Ining the pipeline  what are your Frougtbacker thoughts in regards to how we do that Preventative work as well.  Through the chair  Fred Ill try to answer that  theres many different factors to that  there is Oak 311  I think that all the Councilmembers are aware of where the community can send in areas of concern and those are evaluated and Prioritized based on available resources and based on available data as to areas that should be addressed.","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"03915281c0d8"}}

Weve had situations before where theres maybe a high profile type of situation involve ago hate crime  so at that time  well simply shift over additional investigators to make sure we have more than enough resources to focus on the follow-up investigation involving that hate crime situation.  Wez can of course always use more manpower in the criminal investigation division  however  all hate crimes are reviewed and followed up on  so all cases that have come through and have been reported to our Oakland police Department  criminal investigation division have been thoroughly investigated and we work hard to present the case to the District attorney  if there is an arrest or if there is a person that has been identified  well work the victim to follow up and with the hopes of presenting the case to the District Attorneys office once its been completed  in addition to work witching the FBI when ` we have cases that may need a certain threshold or if we need additional support or resources for particular cases so we do have those types of partnerships with the FBI when needed and work with them routinely.

All of these categories up here are annual revenue  so we would continue to receive our 73 thousand dollars a year in current property tax base pursuant to measure C  we would see almost a million dollars a year in new funding for cultural affairs  measure Z  public safety comes out to about 1.6 million dollars a year and then our general Fund  about 25 .. 6 million dollars per year of which 10.4 could be contributed to the Ifd  so  this 25.6 includes your categories of taxes that I talked to you about like parking tax  sales taxes  transfer taxes  etc.  most of which are not eligible to be captured or contributed or invested through an Ifd  only about 10.41 million  specifically property taxes would flow into  remember this  sorry  Triangle right here  the difference between the 10.41 and the 25 . 6Z is the fixed tax base and all those other sources of taxes that flow to the city.  Now  I do want to make a couple of notes here  again  the Sfrj RI urban full report which has a lot more detail is an attachment to the staff report and its important also to note that this is looking only at direct fiscal benefits to Oakland and really focused on our general Fund  so this does not capture any--what we call indirect impacts or induced impacts beyond the boundaries of Howard terminal  and it also does not include earmarked parcel taxes pursuant to measures D and Q or Ww  and I am actually going to work on getting an update to the report just so we can quantify those for you  those are all parcel taxes for specific purposes  parks  libraries and Paramedic service that is are not captured here so well capture that in the next Iteration of the report  and then  last  just to be clear when we talk about annual direct fiscal benefit to Oakland here  I want to note that all of these estimates are in 2020 dollars as if the project were fully built and stabilize today  so  when we look at this analysis  this is an imagine if you will Howard terminal exists today  how would our city budget be different  how much more money would we have to spend on city services  so thats the context for the direct fiscal benefit to Oakland.  Last  Dave touched on the as proposal for an Off-Site Ifd in addition to the on-site Ifd  so this is the graphic that was in the as April 23rd proposal  you can see - here the Howard terminal site in gray and staff is recommending an Ifd over the Howard terminal site itself.  The as in addition have asked for what they call the Off-Site or Jack London square Ifd which is all of this area in red  so it stretches from--I know its small and probably hard to see  this is the West Oakland BART station over here  the northerly boundary is 8th Street and over here on the East is Oak street  so this - captures basically all--would capture basically all Ofz the Jack London district and then the Acorn industrial district in the area of West Oakland around the West Oakland BART station.","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"6d453051d136"}}

Ill go ahead and list all my Fe questions  with regards to the issue of trash  we had talked last spring about using more trash bins and trash carts for our trash remediation around homeless Encampments which would allow people themselves to put what they wish to dispose of in a bin or a cart as the case may be depending on the side of the situation and thus removing the fights and the strife in terms TOF trash pickup would be very clear as it is for housed people  trash pickup dont get into nights with housed people about what they arent taking because theres a use of a bin or a cart or another - method that makes it clear what is to be taken.  And so to see how that is going  then my final comment ISS we have often talked about that there is only immediate very  very short term shelter and then permanent housing thats very expensive but there are forms of ongoing housing that are much cheaper than what weve traditionally done including modular housing  and also that we could be doing much more around Rv parking and I know well talk about that more on June 1 but I want to make sure as were talk about what were funding that were not leaving out that middle category and then  Lastly  in terms of the issue of equity  the overwhelming majority of people being pushed into homelessness in Oakland are African American but historically our assistance programs have not been reaching African American resident INS the Proproportion of the representation among the homeless so that also needs to be part of what is considered moving forward.  - thank you  Madam President.

So  my recollection is the purpose for allowing the Flexing was to flex to do Crt duties  so it sound like it was written in such a way that it wasnt--that wasnt put in  that when we were told we were going to allow them to be flexed  it was specifically said to us it was for the purpose of them doing Crt duty that is carry over to a different time of day  so Maybe we need to put that explicitly in the document that that is the purpose of which they can be flexed rather than they can be flexed for other thing that is are not Crt duties because thats part of one of the reasons why theyre not always available to do Crt duties and one TOF reasons why people dont want that assignment because they get last minute change of time.  And then the other thing I just wanted to put out there is that I know for certain duties  we have various bonus pay for certain types of things in the city  not just specific to police but for a variety of position INS the city  you get bonus pay for certain things  if this is a position were having trouble keeping filled  should we be looking at that  putting limits ton Flexing  if the Flexing is making people not want to do it  I do think that keeping people on a beat for an extended period of time is better for the community police Resbacker relations  the knowledge of the air Xwra  so I think it would be helpful to look at doing that and then Lastly  Iped to say in terms of tracking what theyre doing  I understand that the individual officers were asked to keep logs of what theyre doing and that certainly wasnt my intent when I asked the question way back when about how oftener were they pulled off  what I intended to ask Quuz a management question  how oftener were they being reassigned to over things  protest  Encampments  special events  not how oftener are they chasing a Mugger in their beat and chasing them out of the beat  Im not interested in having them log that  when are they being assigned to cover a different task Managerially  it wasnt so much intending about individual logs of individual officers  though I can see that would be helpful too  and I would NOTE obviously as you noted the racial gaps that are still there  that needs to be filled and you noted the shortage of officers contribute TOS this problem and that we are currently under the number were budgeted for so we have money to have more than we have  have we looked at doing a lateral Academy potentially as an option to fill those vacancies more timely?  That is correct  yes  we have done recruitment for a lateral Academy  we havent had as much of an aggressive response  so other than that  we dont have a robust candidate pool to pull from for Laterals.","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"fc7cd4546233"}}

So  I think it is really important for a couple of different reasons that we go ahead and vote this approval of this extension as soon as possible.  One  a lot of the folks that are concerned about this are doing really important work in the community and every time we drag out this question  everybody has to spend a lot of time working on it and the sooner we make the decision  the sooner everybody can restore their time and effort to focusing on providing the services and not having to be worried about whether the fundings going to Disa I peer or whether theyre going to have to spend more time Fiekt witching the council about whether or not the funding will disappear so it will free up for emergency to be focused on.  The other reason I think its valuable for us as a Council to go ahead and do this is we have a variety of other topics were looking to putting on the November ballot  a variety of things were working on for the November ballot so to have uncertainty about whether we need to put this on the November ballot could detract from other things that we legally have to do by ballot measure getting that attention whereas this is something that doesnt have to go to the ballot  we can extend it ourselves and so we can save our ballot measure effort for other things that we do need to do on the the ballot  so both for the sake of the youth services that we can extend now and for the sake of other ballot Meshasures that need our focus in November  I dont think we need to wait to have this go on the ballot  I think we can go ahead and extend it ourselves  thank you  Mr.  Thank you  now","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"fc88435b1f70"}}

So  as a reminder  the--Council has adopted greenhouse gas reduction targets  36% was the target by 2020  and Im going to present a little bit on our progress on where weve gotten  and 56% reduction by 2030  83% by 2050  these are somewhat Non-Round numbers because they are in fact science based targets  Council has taken direction from what the science showed from what is reasonable and cost effective emission reduction measures we can reach within that  this plan is responsive to that 56% number  youre to see the plan presented here goes further than that and we believe we can replace this 2050 goal of 83% with full carbon neutrality five years earlier based on the progress well be able to make in this planning process here.  So  Oaklands greenhouse gas emissions have been going down steadily since Council first adopted its targets  theyre all relative to 200 5  its the point at which we measure our emissions reduction over time  you can see the line at the top of the screen  49% is the overall increase in gross regional product for the Bay area  8% is the population growth over that time  so between 2005 and 2017  the most recent year for which we have a comprehensive data within there  our population has grown  our economic activity has grown substantially  over that same time  we have reduced emissions by almost 24%.  That is a Pathway that thank TOS the Covid crisis and an Unfo Rnl Gnat silver line Ising were going the meet the 36% reduction Taster for 2020 because of the steep emission targets well see during calendar year 2020  the unfortunate part of that is there will be a rebound in those emissions whenever full economic recover does occur whenever that is.  So  although were going to show success likely in 2020 for meet thing target  it doesnt change the need for a pretty ambitious a action to stay on that course and stay on the target for emissions reduction by 2030.","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"0be60cfec44c"}}

I think getting involvement from the people who would be directly impacted by this plan  those are the folks in our community who are Unhoused.  I think that thats probably the--if not the most important thing  one of the most important things in terms of putting together a plan like this  and I think the potential risks of things going wrong without having their input is significant - and so I also agree with everyone that this is like a time sensitive issue for the individuals who are Unhoused and for the individuals who live with next to Unhoused neighbors  so Im not asking the Council to take weeks and months to reconsider this  Im just--I think that getting input from our Unhouseless neighbors could be done in a matter of days if its priority and I think given the city councils mission as stated on the citys Website  I think this is a priority so I would just encourage everyone on the Council to vote no today to Prioritize this  to get input from the community PR from the folks who would be impacted directly and then to put something forth in th next week or so  so thank you so much for this time and the opportunity to speak.","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"665c49a5c41d"}}

It is unlikely that the court determine whether or not they should be granted the property interest . The court would make any modifications . They would be basing on whether or not the findings were met under the Ron and whether there was different information that was presented post the adoption of the Ron.

First of all  its not clear that an Off-Site Ifd captures again what we would call but for taxes.  We did some backward looking analysis of how assessed values have grown in Oakland over the last 20 years with - our Department of finance and we have folks Sx  we have Margaret with us today if there are specific questions for them about any of the financial analysis  theyve been key parts of our team  but the analysis that we did work on with Department of finance indicated that weve seen assessed value growth historically in Oakland over the last 20 years of 6Z.4% a year on average.  We dont know what the future will look like  we dont have a crystal ball  but we do know whats happened in Oakland over the last 20 years and that is what I said  6Z.4% a year appreciation in average assessed values.  When we looked at and analyzed the as proposes Sal for an Off-Site Ifd  what we saw is that they were expecting or projecting 6.8% growth in assessed values and property taxes annually in this red area over the next 45 years  so  its I think fair to say that Ifd over the Jack London district in West Oakland would capture a significant amount of growth  in fact  the overwhelming majority of growth and N assessed values and tax that is are general generated in that area would have occurred even absent the project  and absent the project would flow into the citys general Fund and be available for critical city services and investments  not just in this neighborhood but throughout the city.","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"6d453051d136"}}

What are the benefits of a rent Registry so  the key benefit is that it provides a repository for the collection of rent data which is accessible to owners and tenants  owners would have access to tenancy data for all of the properties they owners  a rent Registry tracks all allowable rent increases subject to the rent ordinances  whether theyre annual CPI increases or those granted through RAPS petition process because the rent Registry is tracking allowable rent  they can calculate rent increase and is allows tenants to verify them  a rent Registry allow it is monitoring of units where no fault Evictions such as owner move in or Ellis have occurred to ensure future Tenance--Tenancies complies with rent laws.  All of these mechanisms work together to increase transparency and Xwliens with - rent laws.  Oakland is definitely not an Outlier in considering a rent Registry  Registry Ares used in many cities in California that implement rent ordinances  rap Pyrebacker hired a fuse fellow in 2020 to survey the 8 cities listed here which had established registries and the goal was to gather information on these agencys models as far as efficacy  benefits  challenges and best practices and one TOF fellows main conclusions was rent registries provide the primary mechanism.

{"text":"I just had a couple of questions.  Well  one main question  so  as many folks Noi f know  there was very good information but alarming information from roots community health center last Tuesday regarding a Surnl--surge in Covid and that many of the new cases are being traced back to social gatherings and parties  and with that  the city and many others  myself and Councilmember Taylor were at a press conference on Friday are trying to raise that awareness and the Lake is at least one spot where there is social gatherings where theres not enough compliance with the health orders on masks and social distancing and one of the things Ive been looking into for sometime now even before Covid is how to support our local vendors who are and have been vending at the Lake for a long time and with Covid in particular  it needs to be supported because its a crucial part of the economy as well as the culture and it needs to be done safely  so I would like the ask through the chair to the staff whether there is some flexibility and how this is currently allocated and drafted in the resolution to be creative as the city is exploring a vending pilot which weve been talking about with my office and as there is an Im? ent need  you know  to really make sure that we support our local vendors and that we provide some designated places where that can be done safely and in compliance with the health guidelines and so that we can really work to continue to reduce the spread of Covid.  Thank you  thank you very Mr. administrator?  Thank you  president Kaplan  and through the chair to Councilmember BAS  just to clarify  what the resolution is doing is not determining how the funds are allocated  that has already been done by various Council actions from June 23 through July 21  and we do have an attachment a to the report just kind of lays out those allocations of the cares act funds  the resolution is a mechanism to ensure that we can expeditiously get these funds out the door and spent as intended.  That there is language that lets us Reallocate if need be to other things other than what the Council has designated here  but basically the resolution is just what enables us to execute  its authority that I think was largely in place under the emergency authority but given the magnitude of these funds and interest of the Councilor  we thought and got advice from the city attorneys office that it would be prudent to bring this forth in an explicit resolution  so as to how the funds or the purposes for which the funds get spent  thats direction weve received from the Council  there are some categories here that may lend themselves to support of the vendors  thats something I dont know if director inaudible is prepared to speak to that in terms of it most likely being some of the categories that she has but its our intent to follow the direction that we have from Council in Terps TOF execution  so if the Council wanted to change any TOF categories or broaden language to that effect  we could do so  so as not to preclude an identified use but I also would note  one of the reasons for this resolution is the unusually short Timeline that we have to expend these dollars so were really kind of focusing on being able to push these dollars for the most part into existing programs  so for us to create something from scratch  to create a new program might be challenging with respect to those Timelines  so thats a long winded way of saying the resolution itself doesnt enable or prohibit the use of funds for that purpose  it would have to be within I essentially the authority that the Council has provided for the expenditure of the cares act funds as well as of course the restrictions of the cares","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"0be60cfec44c"}}

{"text":"Thank you  lets see  who at planning is presenting on this?  Its director Gilchrist taking point on presenting this item but I did want to just set some context for this as well.  I think as many of you know  both from your own direct inquiries and also from communication received from the public and am--applicants that may have permits in process or review INS process  weve been encountering long times in terms of bringing work through or even being able to initiate work programs that we had on the ledger for years now in some cases  and much of this has been ascribed to a sever deficit were facing in term of vacancies for budgeted positions in the Department  in global  we have around a 25% vacancy right now but we are also dealing with an uneven distribution of those vacancies across different operating divisions  one of the Onuss that is most - severely hit is the planning Bureau  this is manifesting particularly with the zoning division and with the development planning division or what we also refer to as major projects.  So  we have several initiatives under way  in working with the hr Department  we realized we needed to bring on a recruiting effort in order to get lists for planner 3 and 4  that recruitment started in March of this year  were also looking to initiate for the planner 2 recruitment in June of this year  and all of you who have any time or tenure with the city knows these are some protracted processes from the creation and con feasting--Confection of the list going through interview and is hires  were projecting several months out before we start Bringers those interviews or hires to closure  given the extreme deficit we have in staffing  we have Caseloads that are averaging well above what would be the normal Distributive workload to individual staff persons  in some cases  twice as much  in some case  three times as much  were also facing a tremendous opportunity cost whenever a request is coming in for a particular project around its urgency  it may be urgent around a Fubdbacker funding Arnlbacker arrangement or a grant provision or some other contractual implementation - arrangement for the project  it may be a project the city itself has some investment or a priority in seeing move forward around reaching our housing object stiffer  etc.  but again were severely constrained in being able to meet many of those demands  in order to bridge the time between getting the list con--Confected is to bring an On-Call service Department before the Council for consideration.  Ed can certainly address this as well Whatthis is now  I think theres a little bit of confusion around what this is intended to be  this is not contract employees  this is an outside Outsource agreement really just to do specific work items that will help move applications and permits and so forth through the planning functions when we need them on an On-Call basis  certainly as is the case with other positions  our intention is to be as strong and fully staffed as we can be within the Department  and it behooves us to have full time employees in full time positions and this is why were leaning in with bringing someone on board to help us with NA regard  to supplement what hr can do for us in terms of getting these lists together  but as each Ofz you can understand  every time an Anl Kaition comes in N this situation  we are then exacerbating the situation  we have stacks on stacks on stacks of work that is needing attention and for all the extended time that we have through any process of bringing staff on board  that situation is only going to get worse  by the time we bring staff on  on a permanent position  were going to have a deeper backlog to have to address than we would if we were able to Mover forward with some sort of interim remedy in terms of getting projects - moving through and I do want to say that I certainly appreciate that we want the make sure that we are building a strong staff for the long term  again  in every city Ive worked in  this is a situation that is a cornerstone for economic development  for a cohesive Xlaount development  for Implementations of these plans similar to what we just discussed in the general plan  the specific plan follow through  to kick off work on code amendments  etc.  having a full on Thyme staff thats familiar with the Department operation ISS the ideal situation  right now were far from ideal  and this is really a bridge ` remedy for us to be able to tackle some of the immediate triage weve goats to do in order to get caught up in some of this backlog while Wre ear leading affirmatively into getting our staff on board  and I do want to also say just as a point of clarification that we have asked in the context more broadly to have--we had a survey done for salaries to see how we were within the region  that survey came back and at the time  I know there are conversations going on at our current collective bargaining addressing fees and salaries  that is not something we have any delegation of authority under the Department to address but we did request the salary survey  hr did accommodate us  did that last year  based on that information Websinger were found to be within the range  I do know--of the region  but I do know there are conversations even going to address that matter now  that is outside the rubric of our Department  our ability to engage directly and again were hopeful wherever we land  were in a stronger position than we are today in order to move things forward  that is a different conversation than one were trying to engage now even though theyre all clearly related so again I would like to turn this over to Ed Manasse and Russell has also been helpful or instrumental in helping to pull this together as have other members of the Department staff in contracts and compliance and certainly for the Ced consideration  if there are any questions that you have  well do our best to answer them and if we have to do follow up for the committee  we will certainly do that as well  but again I think all of you appreciate the situation which we mind Ourself from the E-Mails and calls you are getting yourselves directly as well as the general reports that we provide around where things stand in our planning and permitting functions.","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"7e763f5d9e2c"}}

I would also--youve already laid out the pieces around the formerly incarcerated but curious about how you all see the reporting out and whos holding the work of the Facilitator is going to be documenting that  is that going to be left to the staff or is that something that needs to be further discussed  so those are two things  the Mayoral appointee  I could see you moving that and adding an additional youth seat.","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"0be60cfec44c"}}

I mean  you know  lots of time  theres lots of times where buildings or portions of buildings or certain kinds of repairs are needed.  And theres a need to  um  have access to the adjoining property to do those . The reason we dont get this kind of thing is because virtually every single time that happens  the parties work it out .

Its not weird or unusual for someone who need to do repairs or renovation or what have you and you have to access adjoining property for a period of time or a short period of time to do that . thats not uncommon at all especially with lots--especially when lots of stuff is going on around this city . Whats not common is not coming to an agreement or Pathway to get it done . based on what I have read and heard is the owner of the 70 Yosemite  I believe is the address has made--has made substantial repeated good faith attempts to ask for and get some combination of agreements and offer this and offer that  and not get a whole lot back or Im saying  when at the got things back  it became  like  the one--the other party  the Payumos and sorry if I Mispronounce that  they dont want to get to an agreement.","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"0be60cfec44c"}}

I also know that internally  this issue spans--obviously the Department of transportation as well as the police Department and our entire encampment management team which is many departments  as you know  we are currently Transitioning the abandoned auto unit out of Opd and into Oakdot and that will impact this policy conversation as well and that transition is really under way  it wont be fully complete until the end of the calendar year but its certainly under way  so I think that based on all of those factors  I think it would make sense to get a much more thorough analysis back to the Council.

Captain Bolton mentioned this  but the risk versus Fe ward in pursuing auto particular RI suspects is just not worth it for us and not within policy  weve had some success in the past utilizing helicopters and following people until they land some place and ultimately make an arrest then which leads to the final challenge of prosecuting these cases  theyre often considered non-violent Felonies  charges are often reduced to Misdemeanors  we see the same individuals really over and over again committing these crimes.  The final trend that Ive noticed at the end of last year and this year that really kind of occurs on Saturday evening in beats 31 would be negligent discharges of firearms  so I did some research and we found that between about 8 p.m. and midnight  we see a spike in these discharges of firearms.

{"text":"We released the study to the community . We met with West Oakland and met with the Prescott neighborhood group and then we formalized an agreement between the city and the port to essentially the port will lead a process to redesign frontage road and it will he be a community process and that is signed by Sanny wan and Betsy Lake and then we shared that compromise so is basically the compromise is that the road is labeled as a truck route Andit is paired with a redesign of frontage road which everyone agreed is needed . We shared that with the community in February and attended the public works committee.  I want to preface the kettle son slides and I believe that Aaron is here . I think he had to run out for a family obligation but I think hes here.  I wanted to say that there have been a lot of comments about how the city addressed equity or if the city addressed equity and health and I want to communicate that was a concern for the city.  The way that we included an equity analysis was to use the okay DOT equity tool that ranks census tracks based on the relative share of communities - of color  of low-income households as the top rated variables so this is a map of the geographic equity tool and the darker the shades of purple the higher the priority from a resource allocation standpoint because there are high concentrations of children and people of color  senior households  etcetera.  As you can see frontage road it is in a relatively lower priority area due to numerous factors  some of it due to the relative an influence of the Condo owners there and what we found in the study was that if frontage road was banned to trucks which is what the community is asking for that the trucks would divert onto Mandala parkway  onto ad line Street and onto market street.","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"dfd3c9be4dc4"}}

Thank you  I do know just safety of pedestrians and cyclists and everybody is going to be a high priority  and so any questions that might come up or any elements of a term sheet or Eir for that matter that the Council--again  I cant speak for my colleagues on the Council  for me and Im guessing everybody else  thats going to be a fundamental element in making sure that safety and transportation safety is a definite element of this final project.  So  I had a couple more question  one is on Seaport compatibility measures  I know matt and Pamela are still here  whats the status of--and timing of the identification or the writing of the Seaport compatibility measures  who is going the pay any money thats needed to put those into place and let me just ask that as such  so is Thecity staff or port `  Sure  I can give it a shot and Ill invite Pamela to correct my error that is I make  this is a constantly evolving discussion  it has continued to be informed by ongoing input and will ultimately be informed by what is included as a mitigation or sort of mitigate measure within the Eir  some of the Seaport compatibility measure and is the concepts we are discussing arent necessarily purely environmental focused  they have to do with operations ask again refining how we can continue to perfect what we believe to be the project impacts but obviously until you get to the point in time of which you have a potential mixed use development  youre not going to be able to Delineate every single measure or factor  so we will have a little bit more detail for - you in Terp os the broader concepts with some finer points before your meeting on the 20th  this is an Onginger discussion and well have a little bit more to share about some of the project specifics and obviously ultimately they all are subject to again negotiations for implementation with the as  thats our contract partner  but as we are nestled with within the city Websinger are going to be working with the city and helping to better E will be rate--elaborate and explain where the city comes in in both implementing them because obviously if you look at a grade separation or rail corridor improvements  thats - outside the ports jurisdiction sometimes  so we wouldnt be starting a grade separation on 4TH or 5th street thats not within the ports boundaries so that involves coordination  thats a great question  I appreciate that  we dont have much we can share Sparkly  for the purposes of this meeting  that kind of gives you some overall contours.","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"6d453051d136"}}

{"text":"In terms of things that I think is really important that we look at  one of Tem that I know Ive talked about before and I know I told staff when they met with them so I know this wont be a shock to them is the use of the hotel strategy.  As you know  the Biden administration announced theyve increased the FEMA reimbursement rate to 100%  it used to be 75%  its now been raised to 100%  for the use of hotels to house the homeless to get people out of dangerous situations and reduce the spread of disease and that we can do that and be reimbursed 100% and I know last spring in March  the city council unanimously passed a resolution I brought forward asking that we start to do that and then in July in our cares act budgeted option  we included a line specifically naming these hotel interventions as something we wanted to fund and yet we see its not happening and so I think its really important that any plan we have identify which funding sources we could use for that type of program  keeping in mind those funds come back to us  that we can get to use those funds twice and I know in the spring  some people felt that 75% reimbursement wasnt enough but then we spent money on things that were 0% reimbursement  so  now that its 100% reimbursement  we have people living in very dangerous situations.  I think its really essential that we incorporate this hotel strategy and with regard to that  the Council action in July also specified our homelessness - administrator  Mr. Dunston  would have a fund that he would have access to  to be able to put people up so he would be able to be effective in his role and I believe that hasnt happened yet either.  So  I did want to make sure we address those items and then just a couple of other comments  one is that I notice we still dont have the city auditors report  we have been told several months ago we would have it by now.  The intention was that we would already have it by the time we were hearing this item.","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"f93138cb7beb"}}

It really wreaks of poorly done homework  one of the things that people kept Commenting on is that the map that I believe Council is aware is out of date  that seems to show there is basically no place for Houseless folks to go  so I dont understand how you could even consider passing a policy when you dont even know what the map looks like.  Furthermore  I think any new - policies must provide a more dignified way of living for our Houseless residents and I would like the Etch size the word resident  theyre not Interlopers in our community as some Commenters want you to believe  they are our friends  neighbors  and co-workers  and yes  Diana  a lot of people who are Houseless do hold down jobs  and I implore you to go back to the drawing board to send her Houseless folks and the creation and the implementation of a new encampment policy or better yesterday  provide four walls  running water and the dignity they deserve.

There are some questions about whats in the packet and hopefully the additional information will be provide today the Council and to the public when this moves forward to the full Council for consideration.  Colleagues  I have shared with you my personal feelings about where we are right now in this time of crisis and shift  and for me  I think that there is a Precovid conversation and a post Covid conversation  I think being sensitive to our communities and our needs  we all have to anchor in on some truths  at least this truth that I hold that everything shifted in March and things that we contemplated prior to the pandemic seem TOS me we have to be careful as we evaluate the efficacy of them now.  I think everything shifts in a crisis  and that there is a need for leaders to pivot.  I know that every private business is talking about pivoting  shifting their business models  shifting their product offerings  shifting how they manage their employees and human resources  where investments go and I would hope that this organization though we are a municipality and much slower than the private industry  that we also begin to think about our own needs to Pivot  to pivot conversations  to pivot priorities in our own capacity but to produce  so there are several thing INS the packet that I think are worthy of consideration and I want to try to frame this a little bit  Madam chair  and so for the first part  having myself led Reveries here to increase revenue TOS the city to save revenues  most notably with measures Z and the support that we gave to KK and to measure B  there was a process that went into the product that we brought to the voters  and so for purposes of clarification  I would ask Councilmember BAS to describe the engagement and drafting efforts that brought this measure before the body today  how you conducted Stakeholder meetings  who were in the meetings and when those meetings began.","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"905c8609f99b"}}

But what we also want to do  so in the interest of privacy and the PAC and having a good discussion about the uses that the crime lab implements  we want to allow that conversation to happen.

They will come back in September  but we cannot afford to have the crime lab run out of vital supplies to do DNA analysis and Whatnot in their current state while that deliberation takes place  so what I developed along with the PAC chair is three resolved  the first to replace the first resolved in the resolution and then two further resolves to articulate this and I would be happy to read them into the record now if you would like me to so you can have a conversation about it but I think it get TOS the point of honoring the surveillance technology ordinance and not violating it so we can have that discussion  but also allowing the crime lab to do","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"0be60cfec44c"}}

For the as proposal  I find it really problematic and frankly offensive NA the as are proposing to build out a large residential mixed use neighborhood scale development that doesnt include any affordable housing on-site.  A healthy neighborhood is one that is economically integrated  the comments about building affordable housing Off-Site  perhaps even as far off site at the Coliseum betrays the working class current residents of Oakland who will be shut out of the new development  this is just unacceptable.  On the city of Oaklands proposal  I primarily am concerned  the staff terms seem to let the as off the hook beyond the value of their obligations under the affordable housing impact fee ordinance.  I agree with the citys proposal that below market units should be required to be located on-site and appreciate the citys idea to create a fund for additional Off-Site affordable housing expenditures that will help preserve Affordability in the most impacted surrounding neighborhoods  be however the as are only being asked to fund the equivalent cost they would be obligated to pay under the ordinance and any additional costs which there will be  will be paid by the Ifd  in other words  by the taxpayers  the Ifd should be used to achieve additional units well beyond 15 and% and not to subsidize the units that the as should be possible to build as part of their commitment to providing community benefits in exchange for the opportunity to develop public lands and receive taxpayer support for the needed infrastructure.","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"6d453051d136"}}

Second  regarding the macro principles that have been adopted by Council  having Bacs Bay area community services run this program is--its unacceptable.  Anyone who has worked in this area in the Bay who has worked with Unhoused community INS the Bay though that Bacs does not serve our community and align their Wallets with millions of dollars of community funds and theres nothing to show for it  its disgusting that Bacs has found themselves INS a position where they could be awarded this canting so I urge this body to find a way to prevent that from going forward  and then third  regarding some of the callers who are speaking about increased police services in their area during this time  I request the financial reality of reinvesting in policing when we know that were not going to get the resulting in public safety benefits that people think come with increased policing  so when we talk about community resource officer and is we talk about Shotspotter --  Im so sorry  James  your the next in line is Diego pinto  then we have Annie Bank  Mary forte  Aaron gold  Nghiep  a phone number ending in 0501 which I believe is Mr. Hazzard  Ms. Olugbala  Anne Janks and Shaniece Kel Lee.

Our area of concern right now  looking at the map here would be area of focused robberies  you can see in our scale  565 down the 630 and 636  hopefully with our efforts  I like to say to cut that down in half  we were able to do it from 808 down to 567 in 2016-17  our efforts are going to be pretty good  our trend is starting well in a six month period  and in January  try to go after the half period of that.

{"text":"So  this is the monthly count of gun Homicide INS the city of Oakland from 2010 to 2017  what Te Valuators found was that ceasefire could be attribute Witched a 35.1% reduction city-wide during this period of time  during this period of time  there was approximately 43% overall reduction in gun Homicides so the ceasefire strategy is associated with about two thirds of that reduction during that period  the other third of that reduction is probably attributable to other violence reduction efforts  other city based investments and Gentrification and displacement.  This is the impact of ceasefire on neighborhoods  on census blocks compared to comparable census blocks that didnt receive ceasefire treatment matched on prior violence  structural disadvantage and a variety of other comparable factors  what the evaluation found was that census blocks NA received ceasefire treatment had a 20% greater reduction in shootings than comparable block group X census block that didnt receive treatment and sometimes people can be concerned about strategies like this that this displace violence to another place Wla  the evaluation found was that census blocks that were adjacent or next to treated census blocks got safer instead of displacing violence  those places got less violent.  So  in a group and network impact assessment  they took a similar approach  they did a quasi experimental design  looked at high rising of violence networks identified through ceasefire and compared them to comparable high risk groups and network INS the city of Oakland that didnt receive ceasefire network on a bunch of important variables including prior violence  size  conflicts and alliances  how long theyve been around and some other factors.  What they found first is that the decrease in group and gang member involved shootings in the city of Oakland overall was much deeper which is what we would expect from a strategy that was oriented to reduce violence in high violent networks.  They also found that treated groups at 27% fewer shootings than very comparable groups who didnt receive ceasefire treatment.","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"fc7cd4546233"}}

My office has provided--we have a role called a community navigator who provides as needed interpretation and translation but also helps shepherd families in understanding the school system  etc.  so  we do contract with somebody who can provide that for families but its insufficient  its inadequate.  The other thing is I have met on a variety of occasions of our Arabic families t mammas  they feel very strongly we should just as we have Spanish language Programers  we need Arabic language programs  its very important to them  their language and their culture and its a way by bringing in language programs to really counter some of what our immigrant families in general and our Yemeni family and students in particular who may feel and experience--Marginalization  bullying  and its something about lifting up the Cull Klur and affirming ways  that is extremely important for our families so were working to establish a language enrichment program at Mlk  West Oakland middle is also interested so thats one piece were doing  Noition the universal supports Ofz newcomer programming  also supports many of our Yemeni students  English learning development supports all of those students but I understand and recognize that the families do not feel that theyre getting adequate service and I would agree and I think a lot of it has to do with the lack of language access provided.

{"text":"And it will cause more harm to more tenants than the existing ordinance.  I just heard some things said that probably could be debated but I want to make one point of clarification and that is that most condominiums that are sold and not all condominium units are sold are purchased by owner Occupiers  it is only those units that become exempt from rent control  any other units that continue to be held as rental units by the party who converted the property remains subject to rent control.  There are already protections in place.  There are other solutions that other cities that have perceived this problem have adopted  those programs have both benefited tenants by tenant protection provisions but theyve also benefited the citys financially and in terms of housing.  Let me explain  first  the report to the Council indicates that theres a problem and it cites the fact that the problem or the conversions  the volume of conversions peaked in 2005 to 2008 during which time there were more than 100 units per year that were converted  last year according to the same report  17 units were converted  in the last ten year  fewer than 200 units have been converted.","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"89bfa0cd7de0"}}

{"text":"Thank you.  This is Kiran Shenoy with the bridge Association of real estate  we cannot take an official stance on this ballot measure  that is due to a number of outstanding questions I hope we can get answered today  one is--I believe this question may be forwarded to you already  we want to reiterate how important it is  can the authors provide us with a draft apportionment guide  it requires realtors would pay gross receipt transactions  the apportionment application process outline Ined the ordinance seems arbitrary and grants the city wide power over the businesses located within Oakland to inspect the businesss finance beyond the scope of their Oakland business receipt.  We heard from some brokerage officers  the very thought to be subject to this regulatory scheme has thought of relocating outside of Oakland where they may not be regularly targeted throughout the city  so other businesses may be thinking the same thing  with the bulk of their workforce operating remotely  it would be easy for professional services to shift their operations elsewhere.  That wont be good for Oaklands economic Ecosystem  if those folks leave  small businesses in Oakland may find themselves with far fewer customer  can we see the beacon study the authors have commissioned  we hope a printed copy will be printed soon  there seems to be a bit of confusion when this tax must be put before the voters  we are informed and believe that several attendees at a recent town hall organized by the authors may have received the impression that while the tax isnt collected until 2022  this would allow it to be on the ballot or the city would wait until four years  can we get confirmation to Fr the city attorney that this tax can be placed on the 2022 ballot.  We will follow-up further in writing.","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"905c8609f99b"}}

And so having more robust funding will allow for add Voluntaryvocates to be there because when advocates are alongside victims  particularly in emergency rooms  theyre more likely to receive follow-up services  case management  wrap around service  therapeutic supports and is peer supports  so having funding and having the resources available  well be able to increase capacity not - just for local hospitals like high land but other hospitals that currently dont have capacity for such but are doing outreach  so Kaiser  Al TA Baits  local clinic  community clinics where individuals who have been at the ent center Ofz violence are Receiveing services but not classic Forensic services or services during Forensic interviews or examinations  so thats that  and then in terms of making housing available for more CSEC identified folks  that would be inclusive also of adult survivors and survivors of domestic violence  as we know that housing is a critical issue when individual Ares in danger at the hands of a domestic partner or family member  so having emergency housing such as hotel vouchers or hotels or motels that have made deals or have made--or come into agreement with local community Z agencies will create safe housing for them so  we look forward to seeing them receive that shelter and respite.

Which option--youre forwarding option one over option two?  Aim understanding that correctly?  I believe Councilmember Gallo made a motion to support the planning staffs recommendation that is more of a compromise approach that puts restrictions as they articulated today  restrictions on Adus in the very high fire severity zone whereas in the rest of the city  those restrictions would not be in place and much more permissive but does not outright prohibit that  the reason being that the state is not going to go for an out Rao Ikt prohibition in the hills area where theres a fire risk  theyre clear theyre not going to do that  so the feeling is that this - compromise approach with some restrictions hopefully will pass muster with the state and thats where we are  theres been a lot of discussion amongst the planning staff and the city attorney about this for months.  So  thank you for that are you saying--the fire Department is saying prohibit all Adus and Jadus in this--in the S-9 zone  correct  and the city staff--because Im looking at all of the recommendations and I dont see that  that they are--Im trying to understand and I see Jessicas hand raised  to understand how the fire Department feels about the staff recommendations.","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"8cdba4bbe55e"}}

Is there any comments from administrators or the city attorney before I can--but let me--members of public  members of the city Council  the reason I bring this request is a request from the neighborhood  we can talk about equity and this is about the communities that we live in here in the Fruitvale area  East Oakland  West Oakland and this is where the request came from to allow our children to be able to walk to school and back home from school on a safe route  to allow those of us who spent years here in the city of Oakland that live on our streets here in East Oakland  West Oakland areas  to allow those residents to continue to have a safe environment  a clean environment  a healthy environment and be able to respect their children and families to continue to be here in Oakland to be able to not only just commute but to make sure we can utilize our streets  our bike lanes here in the neighborhood and this is where this recommendation comes from  it comes from the neighborhood residents and it comes from also from our schools because our schools are being impacted and the - reality is that were not enforcing the encampment management policy when it comes to dealing with Rvs or oversized vehicles in those streets.  I understand this is not about Criminalization  Im out there every weekend and we have people out there every day and I would invite any of you from the legal departments to come join me any Saturday  any Sunday because my responsibility being out there with volunteers from the neighborhood  we do go and clean homeless Encampments  we do go and clean locations where the Rvs shouldnt be  and so if you really care and youre really sincere  then come join me so you can go on and pick up the needles  the dead dogs  the trash  the vehicles that have been dumped into the Estuary and some of the other activity.","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"03915281c0d8"}}

{"text":"Thank you  council  Thank you  a couple of things I would like to suggest  Councilmember BAS I think mentioned most of them and given were going to come back  if you want to answer any of these now  you can  but Im not expecting you to  one is the relationship between providing toilets and making the trash collection less dangerous.  I want to acknowledge that part of the trash collection problem is Poop in the trash and thats one of the complaints weve gotten  and so to the extent were having more toilets provided  that will reduce that problem  the Council did approve in the budget a pilot to try some of a new model of toilet that was developed in the city of Portland Khas permanently installed but indestructible toilet called Portland Loo  that is fund Ining the budget that hasnt yet been implemented as well as looking at Porta Potties in more places that that could be part of it but I also want to make sure we look at this question about Partnering with folks in the Encampments around how and when and what they do with the trash so that then when the personnel who collects it comes  they should only have to collect it from where it is gathered and not have to go through the Encampments or be in a situation where you would have strife with people  that if you had clearly where the stuff to be removed goes that isnt Intermixed with peoples other stuff  then those who are collecting it should be able to collect it in a way that doesnt involve fighting with people about it because it would have been clearly designated as to be picked up  whether thats in a particular container or in in a particular marked off spot on the side that I think we can look to make it less strife by working with folks f the one GOR badge company doesnt do Pickups there  maybe we should look if somebody will  I know our other Hauler has been participate witching the cleanup with Mr. Gallo  so we may have other options that we can look at.  And then Lastly  I think  you know t underlying point that community members and Councilmember BAS and myself and others have been making about designate allowable Encampments that are governed and managed  in those sites  you would have trash collection  like you have at a campground f you go to a KOA campground  theres places where the trash goes  it gets collected and doesnt require police  so having governed Encampments would then allow for trash removal to happen from governed Encampments in a way that doesnt involve so much strife.  The last question is do you know how much it costs to do the method weve been doing which is public works crews plus cops for each cleanup.","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"67ab78b5025f"}}

However  I do want to make sure we dont Miss what was just said in terms of the conduct of the Department not providing the needed information to the Commission and to my colleagues  I would like the note that there have been several times over the past year that the administration has not properly forwarded to Council what the privacy Commission recommended and in cases where they have not provided to the Privacies SI Commission the data needed for them to do their job  I think this may be called a process issue  it really underlies so much of whats going on here that if my colleagues felt okay with it  I feel like we need to assert as a body that we set up this Commission  people volunteered for it  I want to make sure we make full use of their dedication and involvement and that they had to make a recommendation without having had the full information that they requested not even all the information thats being presented to us today.  Ipg in order to encourage that the process be effective both for this item and all the other items they will consider going forward  I would be inclined to send it back to the Commission with the directive that the administration provide the Commission all of the information both today and the other things they requested so that they could Fwo back one more time and see what may come out of that  not only for the sake of this item but for the sake of really sending a message that we want to see them working together.  Thank you  vice Mayor Kaplan  and to the rest of the committee  please weigh in with your thoughts.  I believe that is fair  ask just listening to the police Department today  they said they have recently complied with some of the data but that is not the data that was requested from the privacy Commission  so if there is room as stated by Mr. Hofer today for them to provide that information to the privacy Commission  I think that would be a fair compromise.","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"149be1e96b37"}}

{"text":"Mri pleasure.  Mr. Alden  thank you so members of this Committee  were here today with two items  items 3 and 4 that you eel be presenting Togetherfinger theyre similar  the action requested here is almost exactly the same.  The issue here is that the police Commission is asking the city Council to approve a waiver of competitive process for two contracts  but one thing thats unusual about this  these two contracts were already approved by the police Commission last year  the contractors were hired  the workers performed  the work has been completed the  worked on the use of force policy for the police Department which is done and moving forward in implementation phases  why is this here before you?  This is here before you because we realized after these contracts were approve and had the work performed that we might have a challenge or an issue with the ordinance that the city of Oakland has that allows the police Commission to enter into such canting and is waive professional processes for inaudible now ordinary in the rest of the city  any Department that was going to enter into a smaller contract like these and wanted to waive competitive process would go to the city administrator and ask for a waiver  thats a process in our current use of the Koe.D its become clear to us some changes that we collectively made to those purchasing and contracting ordinances a couple of years ago to try to broaden the police - Commissions authority to independently create those contracts without having to go through the city administrator turned out to be written in a way that was not as clear as we originally thought.  Last year  we were operating under I think the good faith Mraoef those ordinances have been amended by the city council so that the police Commission could simply waive competitive process itself.","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"8f02293c8663"}}

I also want to note  one  Ive got to thank the team that helped me put this together  staff in the human services Department  staff in the public works Department  staff in the fire Department  other folks in the city administrators office  I want to thank them for all of the support they provided  all the help they provided and many of them are also available for any Department specific questions that you all may have.  And then Lastly  there was some question about the legality of this encampment management policy.  The city attorneys office has reviewed this policy and the legislation and they signed off on both  and my understanding is that this policy is not in conflict with Martin V. Boise and it does not--I repeat  does not criminalize a person for their housing status  and then last but not least  the--there was some discussion around the equity considerations  so on page 1 of the actual policy  youll see three specific bullet points related to equity  ` those came from the director of race ask equity verbatim  and I will continue to work closely with our director of race and equity in that Department to ensure that we are in fact meeting our stated objectives and our stated outcomes and I hear folks saying  well  youve got to conduct an equity impact analysis prior to adoption  its tough to contact an impact analysis before you adopt something to be able to assess  and the last thing is  you know  in policy school  you learn very quickly that to do nothing is a policy alternative  to let present trends continue is a policy alternative . I want to be clear  that is not a policy alternative that the administration is recommending.  We believe to do nothing  to let current trends continue not only is detrimental to the city as a whole but specifically is detrimental to folks who are living in Encampments.","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"665c49a5c41d"}}

{"text":"That we are making is not--nothing to VOT on today but its to think about the Hhap 3 funding that will be coming in the summer and a recommendation to preserve all of our existing interim interventions as well as hygiene sites  we currently have about 563 interim beds or spaces out of a total of about 1550  this 563 are funded with one time funds and are at risk of closing  and the same with our hygiene sites  we are currently funding 60 hygiene sites and trying to increase that up to 100  at minimum  we sustain a baseline of 40.  The four recommendations I just covered are the primary recommendations that staff are making now and theyre aligned with the 1: 4: 4 model  we know there are other needs the city has and other ideas weve heard from Councilmembers which are priorities and I wanted to highlight them here on this slide  theres more detail about the costs of each of these in the Appendix of the - report.  The one I wanted to talk about is the Lake Merritt lodge  this is the largest and most urgent need and a need that just appeared in the last couple of weeks  the Lake Merritt lodge is providing 92 rooms of shelter to approximately 115 Covid vulnerable Oaklanders who are formerly unsheltered  the hotels currently funded by FEMA through March of 2022  we expected the Lake Merritt lodge would apply under the home Kao Rfq process  they were Prequalified in the summer to do that  however  no application was submitted to the city by the November 18th deadline  while ear trying to figure out what happened  it appears there was not alignment on the financing between the parties who have ownership interest in the building.  The services contract for this building is about 2.2 million dollars for the year which is comparable to services contracts and our other transitional housing programs  the leasing cost of this building is about 4.5 million dollars per year  this is far greater than any other program that we have because FEMA is Reimbursing at a nightly rate thats comparable to a hotel.

{"text":"Some of the policies of the war on drugs that are still Reverberating throughout our community are the civil asset Forfeiture law that they use to take peoples property without any conviction and so in 2015 Alon  California SEES 175 million in assets just based on the civil asset Forfeiture law t Antiloitering law which Oakland sensed for over 30 years led to Overpolicing  the riders incident was a great example of why the Antiloitering law proves that the war on drugs was actually a war on people of color  and then the nuisance abatement Evictions which also led to our extreme and dire homeless situation  so  we could go to the next slide  Gamila  so I want you the look at this map which youve seen maps earlier today  in all of the maps that--the equity disparity indicators  these are the same maps  the racial distribution and the total Cannabis arrest and is were talking about total Cannabis arrests from 98 to 2015  that was over 1200 Cannabis arrest  all of these dots represent the areas in which they were arrested  East and West Oakland  the racial distribution for Sxao es West Oakland if you look at these colors represent black and Brown people  so what we see is a dire impact  a targeted impact on these people that live in these specific areas.  Look in the hills  no arrests  the Emerald new deals is Repurpose Oaklands Cannabis tax Revenuer knew to deal with the harm caused by the war on drugs  when I came back in 2017  I saw so many people talking  I thought that they all had cell phones and then I realized that they were talking to themselves because they were suffering from mental health problems and what Ive seen is a Criminalization of the mental health issue  so the Emerald new deal would also help with housing access and Reentry services that would help people create economic self-sufficiency  when we come home  we need support and we have not had that proper support and the Emerald new deal would help to give us that proper support so that we will become the returning community members that we want to be instead of being out cast.  The Emerald new deal would create a planning and oversight Commission appointed by the city council with the majority of committee members would have to be directly impacted by the war on drugs and were borrowing this precedent set by the childrens Fund established by Oaklands Kidsfirst and weve seen that its been very successful in the fact that the city Council has renewed it  so it proves the success of having community members be the ones who help Institute the solutions that the community has brought to the table.  And the key functions TOF Commission would be to produce a report on the impact of the war on drugs in Oakland and use this report as the initial basis for developing a strategic investment plan.  I heard one of the Councilmember Gallo speak on strategy development as an aspect of the general plan  well  this would put that kind of thought into the general plan because this would become part of the general plan  the end harm ordinance had the foresight to include the development of the strategic investment plan  so  I would also like to say that we have listened to comments about how broad our definition was in the beginning  so  we want to make sure that you realize that we have narrowed this issue  so it would be individuals and\/or family members who have resided in these areas in East and West Oakland for at least ten years between 1970 and 2010  and I am one of those people  I grew up in East Oakland as a little kid  Im a Panther baby  and so in any combination of the Oakland police beats that we showed op the map where they had the high drug arrests would also be one of those geographic--excuse me  so then we go to--following the 2010 census tracts which we have noted on our maps  so we brought our maps to define the areas and the people that were impacted  Okay  go to the next one  and so the other things Thatwould directly impact it by the policies of the war on drugs  if you are arrested in Oakland  convicted of a Cannabis crime  if you were a victim or received a ticket or citation for Oaklands Antiloitering ordinance  or if if you are a victim of civil asset Forfeiture program without a conviction  and the other policies and practices pursued by the city of Oakland under the guise of the war on drugs and thats - the Militarization of our police  okay.","meta":{"muni":"oakland","session_id":"7e763f5d9e2c"}}

So am I right to say that the appropriate process would be for the vice mayor to work with the city attorney or whoever  draft the moratorium  put it into rules  and get it scheduled as soon as possible for us to actually be able to consider that  is that correct?
