The pictures of multifamily and mixed-use buildings in the evaluation do not show nearly 50 years of apartments that were constructed in the period leading up to Article 26.  In contrast to the assertion in the staff evaluation  Article 26 does not encourage displacement of low-income residents.  Instead  many of the buildings preserved as a result of Article 26 are home to low-income residents living in a variety of unit sizes.  If Article 26 were repealed  development pressures would likely be greatest on existing residential investment properties whose owners have no emotional investment in our citys past or in its future and who have allowed their buildings to deteriorate.","meta":{"muni":"alameda","session_id":"e906222df2d2"}}

um anyway so the um so theyre theyre um uh this is a renewal um uh williamson in addition to the um rent that they generate they generate a sizable amount of sales tax revenue that um Alameda has been put as a point of a sale for their sales in the warehouse and um so yeah so they are they generate a lot of sales tax revenue over the last few years so we hope that youll consider renewing this tenant right now they have Im just going to give them a little bit of a a marketing push right now they have a very good sale with like 50 off everything it might be worth a visit if youre out there watching but and theyre doing the socially distance only allowing so many people in at a time and its such a huge hangar theyre lucky that they get to allow quite a few people in at one time nice and keep the um keep the doors open for ventilation and just to remind everyone whos watching whenever you leave your house you need to be wearing your mask ill pull mine out and demonstrate later but that includes when youre inside shopping in retail but you know to your point miss mcconaughey williamson is a california corporation um based in our state and uh this has been a tough time for for retailers um all over so um with that and miss potter were you going to add anything to the presentation no nice to see you um so council and i just got word from the city clerk that we we still have no public comment is that correct miss weisiger correct no one has raised their hand or submitted a comment okay so council clarifying questions or motion or what would you like councilmember odie just a quick question so were building this um this renovatement into this lease does that mean theyre not going to be eligible to any for any other renovatement like we discussed you know a few months back on our commercial commercial tenants uh so they they have all the tenants have been notified of the programs that were offering as a city and what they really wanted and initially they were kind of difficult i would like to say but at the end of the day and it just boiled down to them wanting just this one month rent abatement um and so its um its fine and so thats why were recommending it  Okay okay i mean i can move approval if sure okay we have a motion all right we have a motion from council member od do we have a second second and its been seconded by council member daysaw do we have any further discussion not seeing any so may we take a roll call vote on the motion councilmember daysaw yes nox white hi odi hi vela hi mayor ezi ashcroft hi that carries by five eyes thank you thank you miss mcconnell nice to see you and your dog thank you  Miss potter all right we are moving on to item 6 f introduction of an uncodified ordinance amending uncodified ordinance number 32 75 to extend the time the tenants must pay deferred rent from 210 days to 395 days following the city councils rescission of the local emergency this would be miss potters item correct  Yes absolutely im going to be presenting this item um in april of this year the city council adopted as part of its urgency ordinance regarding an eviction moratorium for commercial as well as residential tenants the council also approved as part of that ordinance a essentially a seven month time frame in which tenants could repay rent that was either not paid in full or in part during the declaration of the state of emergency at that time staff was recommending that the repayment period should um be that we should commence 30 days after the local emergency was lifted and then continue for six months so seven months in total and at that time some council members had expressed interest in considering that perhaps more time should be allowed for tenants to repay rent and there was some direction too to go back and check with stakeholders as we have as the months have carried on as we have continued to have a shelter in place order as we have continued to have a local emergency declaration its become apparent that a requirement to repay rent within seven months of the lifting of a the local emergency could create a hardship for tenants and rent could could get up as far as almost a requirement to to pay double your rent repaying your defer any deferred rent if you deferred all of it during the shelter in place local emergency period so we are recommending at this time that the council introduce a new ordinance that would amend the existing ordinance and allow tenants essentially 13 months 30 days from the lifting of the local emergency plus another 12 months to repay any rent that was deferred during the local emergency period and we are recommending that this be done as a standard or typical ordinance where tonight would be the first reading the second reading would be september first and then 30 days later it would become effective because there are sufficient protections in place with the existing ordinance that this does not have to happen as an urgency ordinance this evening so with that im happy to answer any questions okay and we do have one speaker but  Lets take clarifying questions from the council first council member od and then vela i see your hands up councilman mayor um so miss potter just want to clarify if we send us out 300 to 395 days that doesnt mean someone has to pay 13 equal payments of rent it just means that whatever is deferred is due by day 395 right thats correct you um will have time to make your payment of your deferred rent during that period you dont have to take all of it but you could and it could be in um you would pay as you could so maybe one month you could pay back more than another month for example and then during that time frame you could not be evicted for any non-payment of that deferred rent but you could um be served with an unlawful detainer if you dont pay your current rent as soon as the local emergency is um over you are going to be obligated to pay your current rent and then just a reminder um that the ordinance is really set up to be an affirmative defense in in a court proceeding if a tenant is served with an unlawful detainer the ordinance becomes a defense um that thats how its set up to work right but so but were not going to see you know 30 days you know following the lifting of the emergency that if someone pays their current month rent and they dont pay say 1 8th or 1 9th or whatever the emergency goes out to um of the deferred that theyre going to be you know uh serve an unlawful detainer for that portion right that thats correct you you have the 13 months to pay the um the total amount due over that period of time okay lets just make sure we communicate that to people cool correct okay and then council member vela has your hand up ive gotten some questions from folks about where our ordinance um is not necessarily in line with the county ordinance um which uh which ordinance is applicable so it and if one is more stringent uh than the other or offers more protections than the other which one applies so the the changes that are before you this evening would bring this portion of our ordinance essentially in line or consistent with the county ordinance in fact we might have an additional 30 days i think the county ordinance is is a year i dont think theres the additional 30 days following the lifting of the local emergency but i would defer to the city attorney about what applies in our jurisdiction i was going to ask his input mr shin uh thank you madam mayor i think that our position has been that because the county does not have the authority to regulate within incorporated cities that ordinance is adopted by the county does not apply within the city of alameda thank you and and the um the other question that i had is um when were getting the the word out about this are we how are we going about uh getting the word out about uh these uh protections one and two are we doing it in multiple languages so we um lets see we have um we do have our tenant and small business assistance page on um the citys website under the covet 19 and all of our tenant protection ordinances are there along with implementing regulations and this ordinance has an implementing regulation that we will be updating that that um further talks about how how this is all being handled um i do not believe that we um have put up anything in any other languages to date we also um the paralegal in the attorneys office is fielding questions about the about the rent freeze and the moratorium so we are providing information as well as the rent program is and central legal who we are contracting with also um has copies of our ordinance and our implementing regs okay any further questions council member bella no okay any

The idea here was to open up vistas through the site  so that when youre in Water Life Park  you dont feel like youre walled in by buildings  but rather that you have vistas to the water and into landscape spaces on either side  and it really has this kind of open character.  Rotating the buildings  as you can see on the right  kind of really kind of destroys that  that you still get the kind of vistas out this way  but it really blocks those kind of cross-site vistas that we thought was a really nice aspect of the site layout.  And then here  we got rid of the condition over here where we had one building that was looking at the garage side of one of the building  another building  but in having to lay the building out in this way  we all of a sudden have recreated that condition over here  where youre looking at this dry valley here from these units  and so we think thats a real weak point of this scheme.  Another thing that were concerned about is  you know  working with BCDC and staff through the master plan process was really to try and kind of create as much kind of waterfront open space as we could  and so theres certainly the Harborview Park here  but theres a pretty significant open space out at this end of the site also.","meta":{"muni":"alameda","session_id":"71fd83a2501d"}}

Its usually driven by the school district and whatnot But I think that theres a way for us to formalize and strengthen some of those Those processes and whatever else and the shrub seems to be a great place to do that To look at how we can kind of bring those conversations more to the fore with the community  Its great that our Police Department works very closely with the school district Im not trying to say that anybodys not doing their jobs  but having we have heard from a number of parents over the last few months  especially about incidents that have come to their attention and Curious how the city is addressing this and I think its a place that the shrub who took a lead in 2016 2017 on how to how the city should start looking at these issues How maybe they can look at the next step of how they can maybe convene some conversations with the district and and others in the City  that was it.","meta":{"muni":"alameda","session_id":"feea09736f53"}}

One thing that weve done in response to Planning Board recommendations about trying to kind of strengthen the character of this space  and really kind of come up with a hierarchy for those buildings  that youll see as I get into some of the specifics of the buildings  is we took the kind of angled bays that we had on the front  so the long sides of those buildings  and brought them around to those short sides  and then have all of those faces kind of angling out in the same direction  so that they kind of push your eye out towards that view  towards the estuary  and we think that thats a really strong  strong aspect of this design that wed like to try and keep  in addition to other good things that are going on.","meta":{"muni":"alameda","session_id":"71fd83a2501d"}}

{"text":"Yeah.  Yeah  I was just going to say  having served on the Historic Advisory Board  you know  I think we have a pretty good understanding and our staff has a pretty good understanding of what comes within the jurisdiction of that board.  And  you know  I think the standards that are used are there and theyre adhered to where appropriate.  The other thing that I would just add is  you know  and this came up when I was on the Historic Advisory Board  but we spend a lot of time talking about how to keep these quickly erected military buildings  you know  conforming with their historic style.  And  you know  that is very much in conflict with adaptive reuse and making them reusable.","meta":{"muni":"alameda","session_id":"867bbfcdeae2"}}
{"text":"Theres a couple we have a number of ordinances in place in Alameda that make that extremely hard to do from a regulatory standpoint.  And what we also know from experience is that   That is a financially  very difficult thing to do.  Im one of our best examples is the Murphy lot  which some you know  the counts in the planning board held a number of hearings.  This was where they added four units on the tennis courts on in East Alameda.","meta":{"muni":"alameda","session_id":"1c5af3f0368b"}}
{"text":" And the crimes.  But catalytic converters theft  certainly took up a lot of the climate time and other cities that have done this have found that its effective because it also well  and the other thing I would just stay stay slightly from what were discussing but its related.  As I do believe that our city has signed on to support legislation that holds these the recyclers or whoever are buying these   These catalytic converters are the materials from them to impose liability on them.  But I think the the idea of the the etching makes sense as a place to start as Captain with Mullen noted we can gauge Community interest.","meta":{"muni":"alameda","session_id":"6608768e2da6"}}
{"text":"Any  Other clarifying questions? Council  Member Daszak  you look quizzical. Yeah.  No   No  Im not quizzical. You","meta":{"muni":"alameda","session_id":"7a4fe1029139"}}
{"text":"Yes  thank you very much.  Ive been a resident of Alameda since 1994 first.  Let me thank the police chief he diligently looked at and followed up on all of your previous questions and he has developed some policies to address the concerns that you raised.  Chief  Yoshi is clearly a professional.  And I want to thank him for his commitment on this issue and for his commitment.","meta":{"muni":"alameda","session_id":"627bff0fe728"}}
{"text":"And then my other question is can you just quickly?  Because I think theres a lot of confusion and lack of understanding and you explain what affirmatively furthering  fair housing requires and well and Ill ask my follow up when you when you can explain that you know the way this works under state law is cities and this is all included in the housing element.  Theres a whole appendix that addresses  the history of land use regulation in Alameda  and   And and and and some of those prior actions and procedures and laws that resulted in unfair housing practices and ultimately resulted in segregation or differences between neighborhoods in cities  every city has to do this analysis and we did it as well.  You then have to look at that analysis and and then affirmatively take actions in","meta":{"muni":"alameda","session_id":"6d9e3c379116"}}
